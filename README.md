# PHPantom

A fast, lightweight PHP language server written in Rust. Ready in seconds, uses a fraction of the RAM other language servers need, and stays responsive throughout. No indexing phase, no waiting.

> [!NOTE]
> PHPantom is in active development. The core editing features are solid and used daily on production codebases. Extract Function, formatting proxy, and broader refactoring tools are still on the roadmap.

## Features

PHPantom focuses on deep type intelligence. Here's how it compares:

| Extract / inline variable | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Generate getter / setter | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Performance** | | | | | |
| Time to ready | < 1 s | 1 min 25 s | 3 min 17 s | 15 min 39 s | 19 min 38 s |
| RAM usage | 21 MB | 520 MB | 3.9 GB | 498 MB | 2.0 GB |
| Disk cache | 0 | 45 MB | 0 | 4.1 GB | 551 MB |

<sub>Performance measured on a production codebase: 21K PHP files, 1.5M lines of code (vendor + application). 🚧 = partial support. 🧩 = requires plugin.</sub>

> **Want to verify?** Open [`example.php`](example.php) in your editor and trigger completion at the marked locations. It exercises every type intelligence feature in the table, including edge cases where tools diverge.

## Context-Aware Intelligence

- **Smart PHPDoc completion.** `@throws` detects uncaught exceptions in the method body, `@param` pre-fills from the signature, and tags are filtered to context and never suggested twice.
- **Array shape inference.** Literal arrays offer key completion with no annotation. Nested shapes, spreads, and array functions like `array_map` preserve element types.
- **Closure parameter inference.** `$users->map(fn($u) => $u->name)` infers `$u` as `User` from the collection's generic context.
- **Conditional return types.** PHPStan-style conditional `@return` types resolve to the concrete branch at each call site.
- **Type aliases and shapes.** `@phpstan-type`, `@phpstan-import-type`, and `object{...}` shapes all resolve through to completions.
- **Laravel Eloquent.** Relationships, scopes, accessors, casts, and Builder chains resolve end-to-end. No Larastan, no ide-helper, no database access required.
- **Everything else you'd expect.** Generics, type narrowing, named arguments, destructuring, first-class callables, anonymous classes, `@deprecated` detection, and namespace segment drilling.

## Project Awareness

PHPantom understands Composer projects out of the box, but works without setup on non-Composer projects too:

- **Autoloader-accurate results.** Completions and go-to-definition only surface classes that Composer's autoloader can actually load, avoiding false positives from internal, inaccessible, or duplicate vendor classes. You see exactly what your application can use.
- **PSR-4 autoloading.** Resolves classes across files on demand.
- **Classmap and file autoloading.** `autoload_classmap.php` and `autoload_files.php`.
- **Embedded PHP stubs** from [phpstorm-stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs) bundled in the binary, no runtime downloads needed.
- **`require_once` discovery.** Functions from required files are available for completion.
- **Go-to-implementation.** Jump from an interface or abstract class to all concrete implementations. Scans open files, classmap, PSR-4 directories, and embedded stubs.

## Acknowledgements

PHPantom stands on the shoulders of:

- **[Mago](https://github.com/carthage-software/mago):** the PHP parser that powers all of PHPantom's AST analysis.
- **[PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/)** and **[Psalm](https://psalm.dev/):** whose combined work on static analysis for PHP transformed the language's type ecosystem. Generics, array shapes, conditional return types, assertion annotations: these tools pushed each other forward and pushed the community toward rigorous PHPDoc annotations that make a language server like this possible. PHPantom's author cut his teeth on PHPStan, which is why `@phpstan-*` annotations are a first-class citizen here.
- **[JetBrains phpstorm-stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs):** type information for the entire PHP standard library, embedded directly into the binary.
- **[Phpactor](https://github.com/phpactor/phpactor):** the PHP language server whose comprehensive test suite and benchmark fixtures informed PHPantom's own test coverage. Many of PHPantom's type inference fixtures were adapted from Phpactor's reflection tests.
