# PHPantom

A fast, lightweight PHP language server written in Rust. Uses only a few MB of RAM regardless of project size and is fully responsive in milliseconds. No indexing phase, no background workers, no waiting.

> [!NOTE]
> PHPantom is in active development. Completion and go-to-definition are solid and used daily. More LSP features (hover, signature help, find references) are on the roadmap.

## Features

<sub>Performance measured on a production codebase: 21K PHP files, 1.5M lines of code (vendor + application).</sub>

> **Want to verify?** Open [`example.php`](example.php) in your editor and trigger completion at the marked locations. It exercises every feature in the table, including edge cases where tools diverge.

## Context-Aware Intelligence

- **Smart PHPDoc completion.** `@throws` detects uncaught exceptions in the method body, including those propagated from called methods. `@param` pre-fills with the name and type from the signature. Tags are filtered to context: `@var` only in property docblocks, `@param` only when there are undocumented parameters. Already-documented tags aren't suggested again.
- **Array shape inference from code.** `$config = ['host' => 'localhost', 'port' => 3306]` offers key completion with no annotation. Incremental `$config['key'] = ...` assignments extend the shape. Nested access chains resolve through shapes and generics. `array_filter`, `array_map`, `array_pop`, `current`, etc. preserve the element type instead of losing it to `array`.
- **Guard clause stacking.** Early return narrows subsequent code. Multiple guards stack to whittle a union down. Works in ternaries, `match(true)`, with `is_a()`, `assert()`.
- **Generic collection foreach.** Iterating `Collection<User>`, `Generator<int, Item>`, or a class with `@implements IteratorAggregate<int, User>` resolves the loop variable to the element type. Keys too.
- **Generics.** `@template` with type substitution through inheritance chains and at call sites.
- **Conditional return types.** PHPStan-style `@return ($param is class-string<T> ? T : mixed)` resolves to the concrete branch at each call site.
- **Laravel Eloquent.** Relationship methods produce virtual properties with the correct generic type (`$user->posts` resolves to `Collection<Post>`). Scope methods are synthesized from `scope*` prefixed methods and available as both static and instance calls. No application booting, no database access, no ide-helper dependency required.
- **Everything else you'd expect.** Named arguments completion, destructuring with named keys, chained method calls in assignments, `@deprecated` detection.

## Project Awareness

PHPantom understands Composer projects out of the box:

- **Autoloader-accurate results.** Completions and go-to-definition only surface classes that Composer's autoloader can actually load, avoiding false positives from internal, inaccessible, or duplicate vendor classes. The classmap is the source of truth, so you see exactly what your application can use.
- **PSR-4 autoloading.** Resolves classes across files on demand.
- **Classmap and file autoloading.** `autoload_classmap.php` and `autoload_files.php`.
- **Embedded PHP stubs** from [phpstorm-stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs) bundled in the binary, no runtime downloads needed.
- **`require_once` discovery.** Functions from required files are available for completion.
- **Go-to-implementation.** Jump from an interface or abstract class to all concrete implementations. Scans open files, classmap, PSR-4 directories, and embedded stubs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Run `composer install -o` (or `composer dump-autoload -o`) in your project to generate the optimized autoload files PHPantom needs for cross-file class resolution.
>
> If your project doesn't use Composer, you can create a minimal `composer.json`:
> ```json
> { "autoload": { "classmap": ["src/"] } }
> ```
> Then run `composer dump-autoload -o`.

## Acknowledgements

PHPantom stands on the shoulders of:

- **[Mago](https://github.com/carthage-software/mago):** the PHP parser that powers all of PHPantom's AST analysis.
- **[PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/)** and **[Psalm](https://psalm.dev/):** whose combined work on static analysis for PHP transformed the language's type ecosystem. Generics, array shapes, conditional return types, assertion annotations: these tools pushed each other forward and pushed the community toward rigorous PHPDoc annotations that make a language server like this possible. PHPantom's author cut his teeth on PHPStan, which is why `@phpstan-*` annotations are a first-class citizen here.
