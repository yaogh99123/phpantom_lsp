//! Unknown member access diagnostics.
//!
//! Walk the precomputed [`SymbolMap`] for a file and flag every
//! `MemberAccess` span where the member does not exist on the resolved
//! class after full resolution (inheritance + virtual member providers).
//!
//! Diagnostics use `Severity::Warning` because the code may still run
//! (e.g. via `__call` / `__get` magic methods that we cannot see), but
//! the user benefits from knowing that PHPantom can't resolve the member.
//!
//! We suppress diagnostics when:
//!
//! - The subject type cannot be resolved (we can't know what members it has).
//! - Any resolved class in a union type has the member (the member is
//!   valid for at least one branch of the union).
//! - Any resolved class has `__call` / `__callStatic` (for method calls)
//!   or `__get` (for property access) magic methods — these accept
//!   arbitrary member names at runtime.
//! - Any resolved class is `stdClass` — it is a universal object
//!   container that accepts arbitrary properties at runtime.
//! - The member name is `class` (the magic `::class` constant).
//! - The subject is an enum and the member is a case name (enum cases
//!   are accessed via `::` but stored as constants).
//! - The subject is `$this`, `self`, `static`, or `parent` inside a
//!   trait method.  Traits are incomplete by nature — they expect to
//!   be mixed into classes that provide the missing members.  Flagging
//!   accesses that only exist on host classes produces a high rate of
//!   false positives.
//!
//! ## Performance: subject resolution cache
//!
//! A single file can contain hundreds of member access spans that share
//! the same subject text (e.g. 60 occurrences of `$this->assertEquals`,
//! `$this->assertTrue`, etc.).  Without caching, each span triggers the
//! full resolution pipeline including `resolve_variable_types` which
//! re-parses the entire file via `with_parsed_program`.  For unresolved
//! subjects the secondary helpers (`resolve_scalar_subject_type`,
//! `resolve_unresolvable_class_subject`) add further re-parses.
//!
//! To avoid this, we cache the resolution outcome per unique
//! `(subject_text, access_kind, scope_key)` tuple, where `scope_key`
//! combines the innermost enclosing class (name + byte offset) with
//! the innermost enclosing function/method/closure scope start offset.
//! This means `$var->` accesses in different methods of the same class
//! get independent cache entries even when the variable name is the
//! same but has a different type in each method.  The cache lives for
//! a single `collect_unknown_member_diagnostics` call and is not
//! shared across files or invocations.
