//! Virtual member provider abstraction.
//!
//! Virtual members are methods and properties that do not exist as real
//! PHP declarations but are surfaced by magic methods (`__call`, `__get`,
//! `__set`, etc.) or framework conventions.  Three providers produce
//! virtual members today:
//!
//! 1. **Laravel model provider** — synthesizes members from
//!    framework-specific patterns (relationship properties, scope methods,
//!    Builder-as-static forwarding, convention-based `factory()` method).
//! 2. **Laravel factory provider** — synthesizes `create()` and `make()`
//!    methods on factory classes that return the corresponding model type,
//!    using the naming convention when no `@extends Factory<Model>`
//!    annotation is present.
//! 3. **PHPDoc provider** (`@method`, `@property`, `@property-read`,
//!    `@property-write`, `@mixin`) — documents magic members on a class.
//!    Within this provider, explicit `@method` / `@property` tags take
//!    precedence over members inherited from `@mixin` classes.
//!
//! All are unified behind the [`VirtualMemberProvider`] trait.
//! Providers are queried in priority order after base resolution
//! (own members + traits + parent chain) is complete.  A member
//! contributed by a higher-priority provider is never overwritten by a
//! lower-priority one, and all virtual members lose to real declared
//! members.
//!
//! # Caching
//!
//! [`resolve_class_fully`] is called from many code paths (completion,
//! hover, go-to-definition, call resolution, etc.) and often for the
//! same class within a single request.  The full resolution (inheritance
//! walk + virtual member providers + interface merging) is expensive, so
//! [`resolve_class_fully_cached`] accepts a [`ResolvedClassCache`] that
//! stores results keyed by fully-qualified class name.  The cache is
//! stored on `Backend` and cleared whenever a file is re-parsed
//! (`update_ast` / `parse_and_cache_content`), so stale entries never
//! survive an edit.
//!
//! # Precedence model
//!
//! ```text
//! 1. Real declared members (in PHP source code)
//! 2. Trait members (real implementations)
//! 3. Parent chain members (real implementations)
//! 4. Virtual member providers (in priority order):
//!    a. Laravel model provider  — richest type info
//!    b. Laravel factory provider — convention-based factory methods
//!    c. PHPDoc provider          — @method, @property, @mixin
//! ```
