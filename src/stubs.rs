/// Embedded PHP stub support (powered by JetBrains phpstorm-stubs).
///
/// This module provides access to PHP standard library stubs (interfaces,
/// classes, and functions) that are embedded directly into the binary at
/// compile time.  The stubs come from the
/// [phpstorm-stubs](https://github.com/JetBrains/phpstorm-stubs) package.
///
/// ## How it works
///
/// 1. A `build.rs` script parses `PhpStormStubsMap.php` (the index file
///    shipped with phpstorm-stubs) and generates `stub_map_generated.rs`
///    containing:
///    - `STUB_FILES`: an array of every PHP stub file, embedded via
///      `include_str!`.
///    - `STUB_CLASS_MAP`: a `(class_name, file_index)` array mapping
///      class/interface/trait names to indices into `STUB_FILES`.
///    - `STUB_FUNCTION_MAP`: the same for standalone functions.
///
/// 2. At `Backend` construction time, [`build_stub_class_index`] and
///    [`build_stub_function_index`] convert the static arrays into
///    `HashMap`s for O(1) lookup.
///
/// 3. `find_or_load_class` (in `util.rs`) consults the class index as a
///    final fallback (Phase 3) after the `ast_map` and PSR-4 resolution.
///    The stub PHP source is parsed lazily on first access and cached in
///    the `ast_map` under a `phpantom-stub://` URI so subsequent lookups
///    are free.
///
/// ## Updating stubs
///
/// Delete the `stubs/` directory and rebuild. The `build.rs` script will
/// automatically fetch the latest release from GitHub, re-read the map
/// file and re-embed everything.

/// tag (e.g. `"v2025.3"`), `"unknown"` when stubs were present but the
