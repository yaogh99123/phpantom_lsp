//! Owned name resolution data extracted from `mago_names::ResolvedNames`.

//! [`OwnedResolvedNames`] mirrors the `ResolvedNames` API from `mago-names`
//! but owns its data, decoupling it from the arena lifetime.  Built once
//! per file in `update_ast_inner` for files open in the editor and stored
//! in `Backend::resolved_names` for the lifetime of the file.
