# Changelog

All notable changes to PHPantom will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Semantic Tokens.** Type-aware syntax highlighting that goes beyond what a TextMate grammar can achieve. Classes, interfaces, enums, traits, methods, properties, parameters, variables, functions, constants, and template parameters all get distinct token types. Modifiers convey declaration sites, static access, readonly, deprecated, and abstract status.
- **Inlay hints.** Parameter name and by-reference indicators appear at call sites (`textDocument/inlayHint`). Hints are suppressed when the argument already makes the parameter obvious: variable names matching the parameter, property accesses with a matching trailing identifier, string literals whose content matches, well-known single-parameter functions like `count` and `strlen`, and spread arguments. Named arguments never receive a redundant hint.
- **PHPStan diagnostics.** PHPStan errors appear inline as you edit, using PHPStan's editor mode (`--tmp-file` / `--instead-of`). Auto-detects `vendor/bin/phpstan` or `$PATH`. Runs in a dedicated background worker with a 2-second debounce and at most one process at a time, so native diagnostics are never blocked. Configurable via `[phpstan]` in `.phpantom.toml` (`command`, `memory-limit`, `timeout`). "Ignore PHPStan error" and "Remove unnecessary @phpstan-ignore" code actions manage inline ignore comments.
- **Formatting.** Built-in PHP formatting via mago-formatter (PER-CS 2.0 style). Formatting works out of the box without any external tools. Projects that depend on php-cs-fixer or PHP_CodeSniffer in their `composer.json` `require-dev` automatically use those tools instead (both can run in sequence). Per-tool command overrides and disable switches in `[formatting]` in `.phpantom.toml`.
- **Document Symbols.** The outline sidebar and breadcrumbs now show classes, interfaces, traits, enums, methods, properties, constants, and standalone functions with correct nesting, icons, visibility detail, and deprecation tags.
- **Workspace Symbols.** "Go to Symbol in Workspace" (Ctrl+T / Cmd+T) searches across all indexed files including vendor classes. Results include namespace context and deprecation markers, sorted by relevance.
- **Type Hierarchy.** "Show Type Hierarchy" on any class, interface, trait, or enum reveals its supertypes and subtypes with full up-and-down navigation through the inheritance tree, including cross-file resolution and transitive relationships.
- **Code Lens.** Clickable annotations above methods that override a parent class method or implement an interface method. Clicking navigates to the prototype declaration.
- **Folding Ranges.** AST-aware code folding for class bodies, method/function bodies, closures, arrays, argument/parameter lists, control flow blocks, doc comments, and consecutive single-line comment groups.
- **Selection Ranges.** Smart select / expand selection returns AST-aware nested ranges from innermost to outermost.
- **Document Links.** `require`/`include` paths are now Ctrl+Clickable. Path resolution supports string literals, `__DIR__` concatenation, `dirname(__DIR__)`, `dirname(__FILE__)`, and nested `dirname` with levels.
- **Syntax error diagnostic.** Parse errors from the Mago parser now appear as Error-severity diagnostics instantly as you type.
- **Implementation error diagnostic.** Concrete classes that fail to implement all required methods from their interfaces or abstract parents are now flagged with an Error-severity diagnostic on the class name. The existing "Implement missing methods" quick-fix appears inline alongside the error. Cyclic hierarchies are handled gracefully.
- **Argument count diagnostic.** Flags function and method calls that pass too few or too many arguments. Variadic parameters and argument unpacking are handled correctly.
- **Change visibility.** Code action on any method, property, constant, or promoted constructor parameter offers to change its visibility (`public`, `protected`, `private`).
- **Update docblock.** Code action on a function or method whose existing docblock is out of sync with its signature. Adds missing `@param` tags, removes stale ones, reorders to match the signature, fixes contradicted types, and removes redundant `@return void`. Refinement types and unrelated tags are preserved.
- **PHPDoc block generation.** Typing `/**` above any declaration generates a docblock skeleton. Tags are only emitted when the native type hint needs enrichment. Properties and constants always get `@var`. Class-likes with templated parents or interfaces get `@extends`/`@implements` tags. Uncaught exceptions get `@throws` with auto-import. Works both via completion and on-type formatting.
- **PHPDoc `@var` completion.** Inline `@var` above variable assignments sorts first and pre-fills the inferred type when available. Template parameters from `@template` enrich `@param`, `@return`, and `@var` type hints.
- **File rename on class rename.** Renaming a class whose file follows PSR-4 naming now also renames the file to match. The file is only renamed when it contains a single class-like declaration and the editor supports file rename operations.
- **`@see` and `@link` improvements.** `@see` references in docblocks now work with go-to-definition (class, member, and function forms). Hover popups show all `@link` and `@see` URLs as clickable links. Deprecation diagnostics include `@see` targets when the `@deprecated` docblock references them.
- **Progress indicators.** Go to Implementation and Find References now show a progress indicator in the editor while scanning.

### Fixed

- **Double-dollar in docblock variable completion.** Typing `$` or `$va` after a type in a `@param` tag no longer produces `$$var` in editors like Helix and Neovim that do not treat `$` as a word character. Completions now replace the typed prefix in place.
- **Closure and arrow function variable scope.** Variable name completion now correctly respects PHP scoping rules for anonymous functions and arrow functions. Parameters of a closure are visible inside its body, `use`-captured variables appear alongside them, and `$this` is available when the closure is defined in an instance method. Outer method locals that were not captured do not leak in. Arrow function parameters are now visible inside the arrow body while the enclosing scope's variables remain accessible, matching PHP's implicit capture behaviour.
- **Namespace alias completion.** Typing a class name through a namespace alias (e.g. `OA\Re` with `use OpenApi\Attributes as OA`) now correctly suggests classes under the aliased namespace such as `OA\Response` and `OA\RequestBody`. Previously only unrelated classes matched because the alias was not expanded before prefix matching.

### Changed

- **Pull diagnostics.** Diagnostics are now delivered via the LSP 3.17 pull model (`textDocument/diagnostic`) when the editor supports it. The editor requests diagnostics only for visible files, and cross-file invalidation uses `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` instead of recomputing every open tab. Clients without pull support fall back to the previous push model automatically.
- **Class name completion ranking.** Completions now rank by match quality first (exact match, then starts-with, then substring), so typing `Order` puts `Order` above `OrderLine` above `CheckOrderFlowJob` regardless of where the class comes from. Within each match quality group, use-imported and same-namespace classes appear first, followed by everything else sorted by namespace affinity (classes from heavily-imported namespaces rank higher).
- **Use-import completion.** Same-namespace classes no longer appear in `use` statement completions (PHP auto-resolves them without an import). Classes that are already imported are filtered out. Namespace affinity still ranks the remaining candidates.
- **Import class code action ordering.** The "Import Class" code action now sorts candidates by namespace affinity (derived from existing imports) instead of alphabetically, so the most likely namespace appears first.
- **Cross-file resolution.** Fully-qualified class names are now stored in a single canonical form, eliminating cases where completion, hover, or go-to-definition failed because one side had a leading backslash and the other did not.

### Fixed

- **Virtual property merging.** Native type hints are now considered when determining virtual property specificity. Previously only docblock types were compared, causing properties with native PHP type declarations (e.g., `public string $name`) to be incorrectly overridden by less specific virtual properties.
- **PHPStan pseudo-type recognition.** Types like `non-positive-int`, `non-negative-int`, `non-zero-int`, `lowercase-string`, `truthy-string`, `callable-object`, and many other PHPStan pseudo-types are now recognized across the entire pipeline. Previously they could be misresolved as class names, flagged as contradictions in docblock updates, or missing from PHPDoc completion suggestions.
- **PHPStan diagnostics.** Fixed a path matching false positive where files with similar name suffixes (e.g. `AFoo.php` vs `Foo.php`) could receive each other's PHPStan diagnostics.
- **Update docblock action.** Docblocks containing `@param $name` with no type (e.g. `@param $name Some description`) are now parsed correctly. Previously the parameter name was consumed as the type token, causing the action to add a duplicate `@param mixed $name` tag.
- **Rename updates imports.** Renaming a class now updates `use` statement FQNs (last segment only), preserves explicit aliases, and introduces an alias when the new name collides with an existing import in the same file. Previously, `use` statements were left unchanged, breaking the file.
- **Trait alias go-to-definition.** Clicking a trait alias (e.g. `$this->__foo()` from `use Foo { foo as __foo; }`) now jumps to the trait method instead of the class's own same-named method.
- **Diagnostics.** Enums that implement interfaces are now checked for missing methods, matching the existing behaviour for concrete classes. Scalar member access errors now detect method-return chains where an intermediate call returns a scalar type. By-reference `@param` annotations no longer produce a false "unknown class" diagnostic.
- **Hover on empty arrays.** `[]` and `array()` literals now show `array` on hover instead of nothing.
- **Catch clause completion.** Throwable interfaces and abstract exception classes now appear in catch clause completions. Previously only concrete, non-abstract classes were offered.
- **Inlay hints with named arguments.** Parameter name hints now map correctly when named and positional arguments are mixed. Previously, positional arguments were matched by their index in the argument list, so `greet(city: 'NYC', 'Alice')` would label `'Alice'` as `age:` instead of `name:`.
- **Type-hint and PHPDoc completion.** Traits are now excluded from completions in parameter types, return types, property types, and PHPDoc type tags. `@throws` continues to use Throwable-filtered completion.
- **Position encoding.** All LSP position conversions now correctly count UTF-16 code units, matching the LSP specification. Files containing emoji or supplementary Unicode characters no longer produce incorrect positions for completions, hover, go-to-definition, references, highlights, or code actions.
- **Deprecated-usage diagnostics.** Deprecated-usage checks no longer block the instant Phase 1 diagnostic push. They now run in Phase 2 (slow) alongside other type-resolution-dependent checks, so syntax errors and unused-import warnings appear without delay.
- **Formatting responsiveness.** The formatting handler no longer blocks the async runtime while waiting for external tools. Completion, hover, and other requests remain responsive while php-cs-fixer or PHP_CodeSniffer runs.
- **PHPStan stale diagnostics.** Closing a file while PHPStan is running no longer leaves stale diagnostics in the cache. Previously the PHPStan worker could finish and write results back after the cache was cleared, causing old diagnostics to reappear on the next open.
- **Graceful shutdown.** Background workers (diagnostic, PHPStan) now stop promptly when the editor closes. Previously, a running PHPStan process could continue consuming CPU and memory for up to 60 seconds after shutdown.
- **Diagnostic deduplication.** Duplicate diagnostics from different analysis phases (fast, slow, PHPStan) are now reliably collapsed into a single entry per range. Previously, non-adjacent duplicates could survive because the dedup pass only removed consecutive matches, and diagnostics with different wording but the same range were treated as distinct.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **Find References.** Locate every usage of a symbol across the project. Supports classes, methods, properties, constants, functions, and variables. Variable references are scoped to the enclosing function or closure. Member references are scoped to the class hierarchy, so unrelated classes sharing a method name are excluded.
- **Rename.** Rename variables, classes, methods, properties, functions, and constants across the workspace. Variable renames are scoped to their enclosing function or closure. Symbols in vendor files are rejected. Non-renameable tokens (`$this`, `self`, `static`, `parent`) are rejected at the prepare step.
- **Document highlighting.** Placing the cursor on a symbol highlights all occurrences in the current file. Variables are scoped to their enclosing function or closure with write vs. read distinction.
- **Implement missing methods.** Code action that generates method stubs when a class is missing required interface or abstract method implementations. Handles deep inheritance chains, cross-file resolution, correct visibility and types, and respects the file's indentation style.
- **Reverse go-to-implementation.** Go-to-implementation on a concrete method jumps to the interface or abstract class that declares the prototype, and vice versa.
- **Go to Type Definition.** Jump from a variable, property, method call, or function call to the class declaration of its resolved type. Union types produce multiple locations.
- **Diagnostics.** Unknown classes, unknown members, and unknown functions are flagged with appropriate severity. Duplicate diagnostics on the same span are suppressed. An opt-in unresolved member access diagnostic is available via `.phpantom.toml`.
- **Deprecation support.** `@deprecated` tags and `#[Deprecated]` attributes surface in hover, completion strikethrough, and diagnostics. A quick-fix code action rewrites deprecated calls when a `replacement` template is available.
- **Project configuration.** `.phpantom.toml` for per-project settings: PHP version override, diagnostic toggles, and indexing strategy. Run `phpantom --init` to generate a default config.
- **Self-generated classmap.** PHPantom works without `composer dump-autoload -o`. Missing or incomplete classmaps are supplemented by scanning autoload directories. Non-Composer projects are supported by scanning all PHP files.
- **Non-Composer function and constant discovery.** Cross-file function completion, go-to-definition, and constant resolution for projects without `composer.json`.
- **Monorepo support.** Discovers subdirectories that are independent Composer projects and processes each through the full pipeline.
- **Indexing progress indicator.** The editor shows a progress bar during workspace initialization, including per-subproject progress in monorepos.
- **PHP version-aware stubs.** Detects the target PHP version from `composer.json` and filters built-in stub signatures accordingly.
- **`@param-closure-this`.** `$this` inside a closure resolves to the type declared by `@param-closure-this` on the receiving parameter.
- **Function-level `@template` with generic return types.** Functions like `collect()` that use `@template` parameters inside generic return types now resolve concrete types from call-site arguments.
- **`@implements` generic resolution.** `@implements Interface<ConcreteType>` substitutes template parameters on the interface's methods and properties. Foreach iteration on generic iterable interfaces resolves value and key types.
- **Interface template inheritance.** Implementing classes inherit `@template` parameters, bindings, conditional return types, and type assertions from their interfaces.
- **Generic `@phpstan-assert` with `class-string<T>`.** Assertion methods like `Assert::instanceOf($value, Foo::class)` resolve the narrowed type from the call-site argument.
- **Property-level narrowing.** `if ($this->prop instanceof Foo)` narrows `$this->prop` in then/else bodies and after guard clauses.
- **Inline `&&` short-circuit narrowing.** The right-hand side of `&&` now sees the narrowed type from the left-hand side.
- **Compound negated guard clause narrowing.** `if (!$x instanceof A && !$x instanceof B) { return; }` narrows `$x` to `A|B` in the surviving code.
- **Invoked closure and arrow function return types.** `(fn(): Foo => ...)()` and `(function(): Bar { ... })()` resolve to their return type.
- **`new $classStringVar` and `$classStringVar::method()`.** Class-string variables resolve for `new` and static member access.
- **`iterator_to_array()` element type.** Resolves the element type from the iterator's generic annotation.
- **Enum case properties.** `$case->name` and `$case->value` resolve on enum case variables.
- **Pass-by-reference parameter type inference.** After calling a function with a typed `&$var` parameter, the variable acquires that type.
- **Pipe operator (PHP 8.5).** `$input |> trim(...) |> createDate(...)` resolves through the chain.
- **Closure variable scope isolation.** Variables outside a closure are no longer offered as completions unless captured via `use()`.
- **AST-based array type inference.** Array shape keys, element access, spread elements, and push-style assignments all resolve through an AST walker.
- **Docblock navigation.** Go-to-definition and hover work on class names inside callable types, array/object shape value types, and object shape properties.
- **GTD from parameter and property variables.** Clicking a parameter or property at its definition site jumps to the type hint class.
- **Inline `@var` on promoted constructor properties.** Overrides the native type hint, matching existing `@param` support.
- **`--version` and `--help` CLI flags.** Contributed by [@calebdw](https://github.com/calebdw) in [#7](https://github.com/AJenbo/phpantom_lsp/pull/7).

### Changed

- **Resolution engine rewritten on AST.** Variable type inference, subject dispatch, call return types, and go-to-definition all run through the AST walker. The text-based scanner has been removed entirely.
- **Hover redesigned.** Short names with `namespace` line, actual default values, `@link` URLs, precise token highlighting, constructor signatures on `new`, `@template` details, enum case listing, trait member listing, origin indicators, and deprecated explanations.
- **Signature help enriched.** Compact parameter list with native types, per-parameter `@param` descriptions, default values, and attribute parenthesis support.
- **Faster resolution and lower memory usage.** O(1) class resolution, per-request caching, hash-set deduplication, reference-counted file content, async diagnostics with 500 ms debounce, and signature-aware cache invalidation.
- **Two-phase diagnostic publishing.** Cheap diagnostics (unused imports, deprecation) publish immediately; expensive diagnostics (unknown classes/members/functions) arrive in a second pass.
- **Concurrent read access.** All read-heavy maps use `parking_lot::RwLock` for parallel request handling.
- **Parallel workspace indexing.** File parsing, PSR-4 scanning, and vendor scanning run across all CPU cores. `.gitignore` rules are respected. `memchr` SIMD acceleration for the byte-level scanner.
- **Merged classmap + self-scan pipeline.** Composer classmaps and self-scanning work together instead of being mutually exclusive. Stale classmaps are supplemented automatically.
- **Automatic stub fetching.** The build script downloads phpstorm-stubs automatically when missing. Composer is no longer needed to build PHPantom. Contributed by [@calebdw](https://github.com/calebdw) in [#16](https://github.com/AJenbo/phpantom_lsp/pull/16).
- **Feature comparison table corrected.** Phactor capabilities updated in the README. Contributed by [@dantleech](https://github.com/dantleech) in [#10](https://github.com/AJenbo/phpantom_lsp/pull/10).
