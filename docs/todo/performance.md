# PHPantom — Performance

Internal performance improvements that reduce latency, memory usage,
and lock contention on the hot paths. These items are sequenced so
that structural fixes land before features that would amplify the
underlying costs (parallel file processing, full background indexing).

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

## P1. Reference-counted `ClassInfo` (`Arc<ClassInfo>`)

**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

**`type_hint_to_classes` → `Vec<Arc<ClassInfo>>`.**
`type_hint_to_classes` is the main bridge between the type-string
world and the class-object world. It is called from both the
call-resolution pipeline (which already returns `Vec<Arc<ClassInfo>>`
and currently wraps each result with `Arc::new`) and the variable-
resolution pipeline (which still operates on `Vec<ClassInfo>`).
Changing `type_hint_to_classes` (and its recursive helper
`type_hint_to_classes_depth`) to return `Vec<Arc<ClassInfo>>` would
eliminate ~15 `Arc::new` wraps at call sites that were added during
the call-resolution conversion, and would be a natural stepping
stone if someone later decides to convert the variable-resolution
pipeline.

The variable-resolution pipeline (`resolve_variable_types`,
`resolve_rhs_expression`, `check_expression_for_assignment`, and
~30 helper functions) still operates on `Vec<ClassInfo>` internally.
Converting it would eliminate ~29 deep clones at bridge sites in
`rhs_resolution.rs`, `foreach_resolution.rs`, and
`closure_resolution.rs`, but the cascade touches ~86 sites across
the subsystem. The effort-to-impact ratio is poor: each eliminated
clone saves one per-request copy, not a hot-loop copy, and the
parent-chain walks in `declaring.rs`, `inheritance.rs`, and
`phpdoc.rs` will always need `Arc::unwrap_or_clone` for mutation
regardless.

---

## P1.5. Layered class resolution (zero-copy inheritance)

**Impact: High · Effort: Very High**

### Problem

`resolve_class_with_inheritance` builds a flat `ClassInfo` by cloning
the base class and then copying every method, property, and constant
from traits, parents, and interfaces into the result. For an Eloquent
model this means deep-copying hundreds of `MethodInfo` structs (each
containing `String` fields, `Vec<ParameterInfo>`, etc.). Even with
`SharedVec` making the top-level Vec clone O(1), the individual
`MethodInfo` clones during the merge are the single largest remaining
allocation cost (~4 % of CPU in `perf` profiles).

The fundamental issue: the resolved class is a **copy** of all
inherited members rather than a **view** over immutable originals.

### Ideal architecture

Replace the flat merged `ClassInfo` with a layered view that
references the originals without copying:

```text
ResolvedClass {
    own:     Arc<ClassInfo>,                  // parsed, immutable
    traits:  Vec<Arc<ClassInfo>>,             // resolved traits
    parent:  Option<Arc<ResolvedClass>>,      // resolved parent (recursive)
    virtual: Vec<Arc<MethodInfo>>,            // @method, @mixin, scopes
    iface_fill: HashMap<String, TypeFillIn>,  // interface type enrichment
}
```

Member lookups walk the layers (own → traits → parent → virtual)
instead of iterating a single flat Vec. Dedup is handled by a
name-based `HashSet` built lazily or maintained incrementally.

Benefits:
- **Zero-copy inheritance.** Moving a method from parent to child is
  an `Arc::clone` (refcount bump), not a `MethodInfo` deep clone.
- **Shared structure.** Two child classes that extend the same parent
  share the parent's `Arc<ResolvedClass>` — the parent's methods
  exist in memory once, not once per child.
- **Cheaper cache invalidation.** Editing a child class only rebuilds
  the child's layer; the parent layer stays cached.

### Migration path

1. **`Arc<MethodInfo>` everywhere.** Change `SharedVec<MethodInfo>`
   to `SharedVec<Arc<MethodInfo>>` (and same for properties/constants).
   This makes individual method clones O(1) within the existing flat
   architecture — an incremental win without changing consumers.

2. **Introduce `ResolvedClass` struct.** Start with a thin wrapper
   that holds the flat `ClassInfo` inside, exposing the same
   iteration API. Consumers migrate incrementally.

3. **Layered storage.** Replace the flat `ClassInfo` inside
   `ResolvedClass` with the layered structure. Change iteration to
   walk layers. This is the big step — every `.methods.iter().find()`
   call site needs to use the layered iterator.

4. **Lazy dedup index.** Build a `HashMap<&str, (Layer, usize)>`
   on first access (or maintain it incrementally during layer
   construction) so that `find_method("foo")` is O(1) without
   scanning all layers.

### Risks

- Every consumer that does `.methods.iter()` or `.methods.len()`
  needs to work with the layered iterator. A `Deref`-based shim
  can ease migration but adds indirection.
- Mutation sites (`merge_traits_into`, virtual member providers)
  need to operate on the layer structure rather than pushing into
  a flat Vec.
- The `resolved_class_cache` currently stores `Arc<ClassInfo>`;
  it would store `Arc<ResolvedClass>` instead.

### When to implement

This is the right long-term direction but a major refactor (~1 month).
Evaluate after the `Arc<MethodInfo>` step (migration path step 1)
is complete and profiling confirms that the flat-merge copy cost is
still the dominant bottleneck.

## P3. Parallel pre-filter in `find_implementors`

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

`find_implementors` Phase 3 reads every unloaded classmap file
sequentially: `fs::read_to_string`, string pre-filter for the target
name, then `parse_and_cache_file`. On a project with thousands of
vendor classes, this loop is dominated by I/O latency. The string
pre-filter rejects most files (the target name appears in very few),
so the vast majority of reads are wasted.

### Fix

Split Phase 3 into two sub-phases:

1. **Parallel pre-filter.** Collect the candidate paths into a
   `Vec<PathBuf>`, then use `std::thread::scope` to read files and
   run the `raw.contains(target_short)` check in parallel. Return
   only the paths that pass the filter along with their content.

2. **Sequential parse.** For the (few) files that pass, call
   `parse_and_cache_file` sequentially. This step mutates `ast_map`
   and calls `class_loader`, which may re-lock shared state.

The same pattern applies to Phase 5 (PSR-4 directory walk for files
not in the classmap). The pre-filter I/O is the bottleneck; the
parse step processes very few files and is fast.

### Trade-off

Thread spawning overhead is only worthwhile when the candidate set
is large. Skip parallelism when the candidate count is below a
threshold (e.g. 8 files).

---

## P4. `memmem` for block comment terminator search

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

The current block comment skip in `find_classes` and `find_symbols`
uses `memchr(b'*', ...)` and then checks the next byte for `/`.
This is effective but can false-match on `*` characters inside
docblock annotations (e.g. `@param`, `@return`, starred lines).
Each false match falls through to a single-byte advance, which is
correct but suboptimal for large docblocks.

### Fix

Replace `memchr(b'*', ...)` with `memmem::find(content[i..], b"*/")`.
This searches for the two-byte sequence `*/` directly, skipping all
intermediate `*` characters in a single SIMD pass. The `memmem`
searcher is already imported and used for keyword pre-screening.

For typical PHP files this is a marginal improvement. For files with
very large docblocks (e.g. generated API documentation classes with
hundreds of `@method` tags), it avoids O(n) false `*` matches inside
the comment body.

---

## P5. `memmap2` for file reads during scanning

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

All file-scanning paths (`scan_files_parallel_classes`,
`scan_files_parallel_psr4`, `scan_files_parallel_full`, and the
`find_implementors` pre-filter) use `std::fs::read(path)` which
copies the entire file into a heap-allocated `Vec<u8>`. When the OS
page cache already has the file mapped, `memmap2` can provide a
read-only view of the file's pages without any copy.

### Fix

Add `memmap2` as a dependency. In the parallel scan helpers, replace
`std::fs::read(path)` with `unsafe { Mmap::map(&file) }`. The
`find_classes` and `find_symbols` scanners already accept `&[u8]`,
so the change is confined to the call sites.

### Safety

Memory-mapped reads are `unsafe` because another process could
truncate the file while the map is live, causing a SIGBUS. In
practice this does not happen during LSP initialization (the user is
not deleting PHP files while the editor starts). A fallback to
`fs::read` on map failure handles edge cases.

### When to implement

Profile first. On Linux with a warm page cache the difference
between `read` and `mmap` is small for files under ~100 KB (which
covers most PHP files). The benefit is more pronounced on macOS
where `read` involves an extra kernel-to-userspace copy. If
profiling shows that file I/O is no longer the bottleneck after
parallelisation, this item can be dropped.

---

## P6. O(n²) transitive eviction in `evict_fqn`

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

The `evict_fqn` function in `virtual_members/mod.rs` runs a
fixed-point loop that scans the entire resolved-class cache on each
iteration to find transitive dependents. In a large project with a
deep class hierarchy (common in Laravel codebases with hundreds of
Eloquent models), editing a base class can trigger a cascade of
evictions where each round does a full cache scan.

The `depends_on_any` helper also matches against both the FQN and
the short name of the evicted class, which increases the chance of
false-positive transitive evictions (e.g. two unrelated classes that
share a short name like `Builder`).

### Fix

Build a reverse-dependency index (`HashMap<String, Vec<String>>`)
that maps each FQN to the set of cached FQNs that directly depend
on it. Maintain this index alongside cache insertions and removals.
On eviction, walk the reverse index instead of scanning the entire
cache, turning the O(n²) loop into O(dependents).

If the reverse index is too much bookkeeping, a simpler first step
is to collect all dependents in a single pass (instead of the
current iterative fixed-point loop) by doing a breadth-first walk
of the dependency graph within the cache.

---

## P7. `diag_pending_uris` uses `Vec::contains` for deduplication

**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

`schedule_diagnostics` and `schedule_diagnostics_for_open_files`
deduplicate pending URIs with `Vec::contains`, which is O(n) per
insertion. When a class signature changes, every open file is
queued, and each insertion scans the entire pending list.

For typical usage (< 50 open files) this is imperceptible. It
becomes measurable only with hundreds of open tabs and rapid
cross-file edits.

### Fix

Replace `Vec<String>` with `IndexSet<String>` (from `indexmap`) or
`HashSet<String>` + a separate `Vec<String>` for ordering. The
worker drains the collection on each wake, so insertion order is
not important and a plain `HashSet` suffices.

---

## P8. `find_class_in_ast_map` linear fallback scan

**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

The fast O(1) `fqn_index` lookup in `find_class_in_ast_map` covers
the common case. The slow fallback iterates every file in `ast_map`
linearly. The comment says this covers "race conditions during
initial indexing" and anonymous classes.

During initial indexing with many files open, the fallback could
cause micro-stutters if the `fqn_index` has not been populated yet
for a requested class. In steady state the fallback is rarely hit.

### Fix

Audit the code paths that can reach the fallback to determine
whether they are still reachable after the `fqn_index` was added.
If they are not, replace the fallback with a `None` return and a
debug log. If they are, consider populating `fqn_index` earlier in
the pipeline (e.g. during the byte-level scan phase) to close the
window.

---

## P9. `resolved_class_cache` generic-arg specialisation

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

The resolved-class cache is keyed by `(FQN, Vec<String>)`. Every
distinct generic instantiation of the same class (e.g.
`Builder<User>`, `Builder<Order>`, `Builder<Product>`) triggers a
full `resolve_class_fully` call, even though the base resolution
(inheritance merging, trait merging, virtual member injection) is
identical. Only the final generic substitution differs.

In a Laravel codebase with hundreds of Eloquent models, this means
`Builder` is fully resolved hundreds of times, once per model.

### Fix

Cache the base-resolved class (before generic substitution)
separately, keyed by FQN alone. When a generic instantiation is
requested, look up the base-resolved class and apply
`apply_substitution` on top. The substitution step is cheap
(tree walk) compared to the full resolution (inheritance walking,
trait merging, virtual member providers).

This requires splitting `resolve_class_fully` into two stages:
base resolution (cached by FQN) and generic specialisation (cached
by `(FQN, Vec<String>)` as today, but with a much cheaper miss
path).

---

## P10. Redundant `parse_and_cache_file` from multiple threads

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

When two threads simultaneously try to resolve the same vendor
class, both miss `fqn_index`, both call `parse_and_cache_file`,
and both parse the same file. The second parse is wasted work.
This is most visible during the Phase 2 diagnostic pass when many
threads resolve vendor classes for the first time.

### Fix

Add a `DashSet<String>` (or similar) of "currently being parsed"
URIs. Before calling `parse_and_cache_file`, insert the URI into
the set. If the insert fails (another thread is already parsing
it), spin-wait or skip and let the other thread's result propagate
through `fqn_index`. Remove the URI from the set after parsing
completes.

---

## P11. Uncached base-resolution in `build_scope_methods_for_builder`

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

`build_scope_methods_for_builder` calls
`resolve_class_with_inheritance` (base resolution) for the model
class. This is not covered by the thread-local resolved-class
cache, which stores fully-resolved classes (after virtual member
injection), not base-resolved ones.

Every time an Eloquent `Builder<Model>` is resolved with scope
injection, the model is base-resolved from scratch. With many
Builder instantiations in a single file this adds up.

### Fix

Either introduce a separate base-resolution cache (keyed by FQN),
or restructure so `build_scope_methods_for_builder` accepts the
already-resolved model class from the caller (which may already
have it from the resolved-class cache).

---

## P12. `find_or_load_function` Phase 1.75 serial bottleneck

**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

For the first unknown function that misses both `global_functions`
and `autoload_function_index`, Phase 1.75 iterates all known
autoload file paths and calls `update_ast` on each unparsed one
until the function is found. With ~50 autoload files this is a
one-time cost per thread, but it blocks the thread while it
happens.

### Fix

Pre-load all autoload files during initialisation (in the
`initialized` handler, after the byte-level scan). This moves the
cost to startup, where it can run in parallel with other init work,
and eliminates the blocking fallback during interactive use.

---

## P13. Tiered storage: drop per-file maps for non-open files

**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium-High**

> **Note.** This item needs refinement when we work on it. The
> codebase and feature set may change significantly before then.

Not every file needs the same data at runtime. Storage should be
split into three tiers based on how the file is used:

| Data              | Open files | Closed user files   | Vendor files        |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| ClassInfo (full)  | keep       | keep (via fqn_index)| keep (via fqn_index)|
| SymbolMap         | keep       | drop (on-demand for find-refs) | never     |
| use_map           | keep       | drop after index    | drop after index    |
| namespace_map     | keep       | drop after index    | drop after index    |
| parse_errors      | keep       | never               | never               |
| ast_map entry     | keep       | drop (redundant with fqn_index) | drop     |
| fqn_index         | keep       | keep                | keep                |
| class_index       | keep       | keep                | keep                |
| GTI index (new)   | keep       | keep                | keep                |

**Key observations:**

- **SymbolMap is the biggest win.** Each SymbolMap stores a
  SymbolSpan for every symbol reference in the file, plus
  VarDefSite, CallSite, and scope data. A typical file with
  100-500 symbols is several KB. Across thousands of files this
  adds up to tens or hundreds of MB.

- **ast_map entries are redundant with fqn_index** once indexing
  is complete. The slow linear fallback in `find_class_in_ast_map`
  should not fire when fqn_index is fully populated. Go-to-definition
  can re-parse on demand using the file path from class_index.

- **Vendor files are never edited, never diagnosed.** They only
  need ClassInfo for type resolution and class_index for
  go-to-definition file lookup.

- **Go-to-implementation currently scans all ast_map entries.**
  A dedicated GTI index (parent FQN to list of child FQNs, built
  during indexing) would decouple it from ast_map and allow
  ast_map entries for non-open files to be dropped without
  breaking implementation search. GTI needs vendor data (to find
  chains through vendor classes) but only the parent/child
  relationship, not the full per-file maps.

- **Find-references only needs SymbolMaps for user code.** These
  could be built on demand (parse, scan, drop) rather than kept
  resident.

- **Analyse mode benefits from laziness.** It never loads vendor
  files that are not referenced by any user chain. LSP mode with
  full vendor indexing would load everything since it cannot
  predict what the user will type next. This makes the tiered
  cleanup more important for LSP than for analyse.

### Implementation sketch

1. Track which URIs are "open" (already done via `open_files`).
2. On `did_close`, drop the SymbolMap, use_map, namespace_map,
   parse_errors, and ast_map entries for that URI. The fqn_index
   entry (Arc\<ClassInfo\>) stays.
3. For vendor files, use `parse_and_cache_content` (not
   `update_ast`) so SymbolMaps are never created. After indexing,
   sweep vendor URIs out of ast_map/use_map/namespace_map.
4. Build a dedicated GTI index during indexing so that
   `find_implementors` does not need ast_map.
5. For find-references, build SymbolMaps on demand by re-parsing
   from disk.

---

## P14. Eager docblock parsing into structured fields

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

> **Note.** This item needs refinement when we work on it. The
> codebase and feature set may change significantly before then.

Currently `ClassInfo::class_docblock` stores the raw docblock
string. Every consumer that needs virtual members (`@method`,
`@property`, `@property-read`, `@property-write`) re-parses the
raw text via `PHPDocProvider`. Hover, completion, and diagnostics
all trigger this independently.

Parse the class-level docblock once during extraction and store the
structured results directly on ClassInfo:

- A list of parsed `@method` signatures (name, parameters, return
  type, static flag, description).
- A list of parsed `@property` / `@property-read` /
  `@property-write` entries (name, type, access mode, description).

This has three benefits:

1. **Drop the raw string.** For heavily-annotated classes (Eloquent
   models, facades) the raw docblock can be hundreds of bytes.
   The structured representation may be comparable in size but is
   directly usable without re-parsing.

2. **Eliminate repeated parsing.** Virtual member resolution
   currently re-parses the same docblock text on every completion,
   hover, and diagnostic pass. Parsing once during extraction
   removes this redundant work.

3. **Simpler consumer code.** Consumers iterate structured fields
   instead of calling into the docblock parser. This removes the
   lazy-parse indirection and makes the data flow easier to follow.

The same principle applies to other docblock data that is currently
extracted from raw text at multiple read sites (descriptions, link
URLs, see references), though those are smaller wins.

---

## P15. Two-phase stub index construction (eliminate `RwLock` on stub maps)

**Impact: Low · Effort: Medium**

The three stub indexes (`stub_index`, `stub_function_index`,
`stub_constant_index`) are write-once-read-many maps. They are
populated at construction time from the compiled-in phpstorm-stubs
arrays, then filtered once in `set_php_version` (called during
`initialized`) to evict entries with `@removed X.Y` tags. After
that single mutation they are never written again.

Because the PHP version is not known at construction time (it comes
from `composer.json` / `.phpantom.toml`, read during `initialized`),
the maps are currently wrapped in `parking_lot::RwLock` so that
`set_php_version` can call `.write().retain(…)`. Every subsequent
read — ~24 call sites across completion, resolution, diagnostics,
hover, and definition — acquires a shared read lock. On the
uncontended path this is a single atomic CAS (~1-5 ns), so the
cost is negligible in practice, but it is architecturally wasteful
for data that never changes after startup.

### Ideal solution

Split `Backend` construction into two phases so that the stub maps
are plain `HashMap`s with zero synchronisation cost on reads:

1. **Phase 1 — skeleton construction.** Create the `Backend` with
   empty (or placeholder) stub maps. No `RwLock` needed because
   nothing reads them yet.

2. **Phase 2 — version-aware population.** In `initialized`, after
   detecting the PHP version, build the filtered maps (applying
   `is_stub_function_removed` / `is_stub_class_removed` during
   construction rather than via `retain`) and store them on the
   backend through a one-shot setter that consumes the maps by
   value.

The setter could use `std::sync::OnceLock<HashMap<…>>` (or simply
an `UnsafeCell` behind a "set-exactly-once" assertion) to make the
write safe without ongoing read-side cost. Alternatively, the
fields can stay as plain `HashMap` if the `Backend` struct is built
in `initialized` rather than `initialize` — moving construction
after the version is known.

### Prerequisites

This interacts with the test helpers (`new_test`,
`new_test_with_stubs`, etc.) which currently call
`set_php_version` in the constructor. They would need to accept
a `PhpVersion` parameter or build the filtered maps inline.

### When to implement

Low priority. The current `RwLock` overhead is unmeasurable in
practice (~10-20 ns per completion request). Worth revisiting if
the stub indexes grow significantly or if `Backend` construction
is restructured for other reasons (e.g. P13 tiered storage).

---

## P16. Pre-parsed stub format (eliminate raw PHP embedding)

**Impact: High · Effort: Medium-High**

The 630 phpstorm-stubs PHP files are embedded as raw source via
`include_str!` (~9.8 MB in `.rodata`). This has three costs:

1. **Permanent RSS.** The 9.8 MB is memory-mapped into every
   process regardless of how many stubs are actually accessed.
   That is ~17% of the current 59 MB baseline and will become a
   larger relative share as vendor indexing grows the working set.

2. **Parse cost on first access.** Each stub is parsed with the
   full mago parser on first use (`parse_and_cache_content_versioned`).
   Large files like `intl.php` (296 KB) take several milliseconds.
   A Symfony project can trigger hundreds of stub parses as vendor
   classes extend built-in types.

3. **Duplicate data.** After parsing, the `Arc<ClassInfo>` lives in
   `ast_map` and `fqn_index`, but the raw PHP source stays resident
   in `.rodata` forever. Both copies exist simultaneously.

### Indexing order: stubs → vendor → user

Background indexing will load data in dependency order:

1. **Stubs** (built-in PHP classes, functions, constants)
2. **Vendor** (Composer dependencies)
3. **User** (project source)

This ordering means every layer's parent types are already
resolved before it starts. Vendor classes that extend `ArrayAccess`,
`Iterator`, `JsonSerializable`, etc. find pre-populated
`fqn_index` entries instead of triggering on-demand stub parses.
User classes that extend vendor classes find those already indexed
too.

With the current raw-PHP stubs, the stubs phase itself involves
parsing ~530 PHP files through the full mago pipeline. In a
pre-parsed format, this phase becomes a single deserialization
step (~5-10 ms), making the stubs layer essentially free and
letting vendor indexing start immediately.

### Cascade cost during first-file-open

When the user opens a file before background indexing completes,
the completion/hover path walks type chains synchronously. A
typical Laravel file triggers a cascade like:

- Model → `find_or_load_class` → classmap → parse vendor PHP
- Model implements `ArrayAccess`, `JsonSerializable`, `Countable`,
  uses `Traversable`, `Iterator`, `Stringable`, etc.
- Each of these hits Phase 3 (stub lookup) → full mago parse of
  the stub file containing it
- Stub files contain multiple classes, so parsing `SPL/SPL.php`
  for `ArrayAccess` also parses `Iterator`, `Countable`,
  `SeekableIterator`, etc.

A realistic first-open cascade triggers 20-40 stub file parses,
costing 40-200 ms of CPU time on the critical path. With
pre-parsed stubs, each stub lookup becomes a `HashMap::get`
returning an `Arc<ClassInfo>` in nanoseconds, eliminating this
cost entirely.

### Solution

Parse all stubs at build time in `build.rs` (mago becomes a build
dependency) and serialize the extracted `ClassInfo`, `FunctionInfo`,
and constant data into a compact binary blob using postcard (or
bincode). Embed the blob via `include_bytes!`. At startup,
deserialize the blob and populate `fqn_index` directly.

**Version filtering.** Add `since: Option<PhpVersion>` and
`until: Option<PhpVersion>` fields to `MethodInfo`, `ParameterInfo`,
`FunctionInfo`, `ClassInfo`, and `ConstantInfo`. Embed one
"maximal" blob containing all version variants. After
deserialization, filter elements whose version range excludes the
target PHP version. This replaces both the current byte-level
`@removed` scanning at startup and the `is_available_for_version`
AST filtering at parse time.

**Serde on the type hierarchy.** Add `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]`
to the core structs (`ClassInfo`, `MethodInfo`, `PropertyInfo`,
`ConstantInfo`, `FunctionInfo`, `ParameterInfo`, and their
supporting enums). `SharedVec<T>` needs a custom serde impl that
serializes as `Vec<T>` and deserializes into `SharedVec::from(vec)`.

**What gets removed:**

- The `STUB_FILES` array (raw PHP source embedding)
- The `phpantom-stub://` URI scheme and associated `ast_map` entries
- The `parse_and_cache_content_versioned` path for stubs
- The `is_stub_function_removed` / `is_stub_class_removed` byte
  scanners (replaced by version fields on deserialized structs)
- The `set_php_version` retain-based eviction (replaced by
  post-deserialize filtering)

**Go-to-definition.** Stubs are in-memory-only; the IDE cannot
navigate to them anyway. No raw source needs to be preserved.

**Hover.** The extracted fields (`class_docblock`, `deprecation_message`,
`links`, `see_refs`, parameter type hints and names) are all
carried in the serialized structs. Hover quality is preserved.

### Estimated impact

- **Binary:** −9.8 MB raw PHP, +2-3 MB serialized blob = net −7 MB
- **RSS:** 9.8 MB `.rodata` no longer mapped; stubs loaded as
  heap-allocated structs filtered to the target PHP version
- **First-file-open:** 40-200 ms of stub parse time on the
  critical path eliminated; stub lookups drop to nanoseconds
- **Background indexing:** stubs phase drops from seconds (parsing
  530 PHP files) to <10 ms (deserializing one blob), letting
  vendor indexing start immediately
- **Vendor indexing cascade:** every vendor class that extends a
  built-in type no longer triggers a stub parse; the parent
  `ClassInfo` is already in `fqn_index`
- **Build time:** clean builds gain 10-30 s for the mago parse
  step; incremental builds unaffected (`write_if_changed` caching)

### Prerequisites

- `serde` derive on the core type hierarchy (already in `Cargo.toml`)
- `build.rs` already downloads stubs and generates code; extending
  it to parse PHP is incremental
- Interacts with P15 (stub index `RwLock` elimination): if stubs
  are deserialized eagerly, the two-phase construction in P15
  becomes the natural approach

### When to implement

High priority. This is a prerequisite for efficient stubs → vendor
→ user indexing. The 9.8 MB static cost is already meaningful and
will become the dominant fixed overhead once vendor indexing is
deferred. Implementing this before full vendor indexing lands
avoids hitting the memory ceiling and ensures the stubs layer is
essentially free for both eager and deferred indexing paths.

## P17. `mago-names` resolution on the parse hot path

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

The `mago-names` name resolver runs synchronously inside
`update_ast_inner`, adding a full AST walk plus an owned `HashMap`
copy on every `didChange` event. Measured regression from `6a0737a`
("Migrate to use mago-names"):

| Benchmark        | Before | After | Δ    |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| with_narrowing   | 12 ms  | 15 ms | +25% |
| 5_methods_chain  | 8 ms   | 10 ms | +25% |
| carbon_class     | 250 ms | 340 ms | +36% |
| large_file       | 150 ms | 210 ms | +40% |

The resolved names are currently consumed only by diagnostics (which
run asynchronously) and `FileContext::resolve_name_at()`. Nothing on
the completion hot path requires this data to be computed eagerly.

### Fix

Defer name resolution out of `update_ast_inner`. Options:

- **Lazy resolution:** compute `OwnedResolvedNames` on first access
  per file version, invalidate on the next `update_ast`. Moves the
  cost off the typing hot path entirely.
- **Diagnostic-worker resolution:** run the resolver in the
  diagnostic worker clone of `Backend`, since diagnostics are the
  primary consumer.

### When to implement

Low priority. The `mago-names` migration is complete, but the
`use_map` is still used by several consumers. Further refactoring
(migrating more consumers to byte-offset lookups, eventually
removing `use_map`) will change the access patterns. Optimizing
now would likely be reworked. Revisit once `use_map` usage is
significantly reduced.

## P18. Subtype result caching

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

PHPStan caches subtype check results (`isSuperTypeOf()`) in a static
`HashMap` keyed by type description strings. This avoids redundant
class hierarchy walks when the same type pair is checked multiple
times during a single request. PHPantom resolves class hierarchies
repeatedly during completion (checking if a method override is
covariant, checking if a class implements an interface, etc.). A
per-request `HashMap<(String, String), bool>` cache for subtype
results would reduce redundant hierarchy walks.

PHPStan also uses a `hasTemplateOrLateResolvableType()` fast-path
to skip expensive type traversal when a type has no template
parameters. PHPantom could add a similar flag to its type
representations to short-circuit template substitution on simple
types. Most types in a typical codebase are concrete (no generics),
so this fast-path would apply to the majority of checks.

### Fix

1. Add a thread-local or per-request
   `HashMap<(String, String), bool>` that caches the result of
   "is type A a subtype of type B?" lookups. Clear the map at the
   start of each completion/hover/diagnostic request.

2. Add a `has_template_params: bool` flag (or equivalent) to
   `ClassInfo` or type representations. Set it during parsing when
   `@template` tags or generic syntax are present. Before running
   `apply_substitution`, check the flag and skip the substitution
   walk entirely when it is `false`.

3. Intern class name strings. PHPantom creates many copies of the
   same class name (e.g. `"Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Builder"`)
   across `ClassInfo`, type strings, and lookup keys. Mago already
   uses `Atom` (an interned string type) in its crates, and names
   flowing through `mago-names` / `mago-syntax` are already atoms.
   Using `Atom` or `Arc<str>` for class names in PHPantom's own
   data structures would reduce memory and make the subtype cache
   keys cheaper to hash and compare. This becomes a natural
   consequence of T19 (structured type representation) since each
   type node would store an interned name rather than an owned
   `String`.

```sh
# Record (Ctrl-C after ~60s):
perf record -g --call-graph dwarf -- \
  ./target/release/phpantom_lsp analyze \

### Pathological test file

`PurchaseFileService.php` (~700-line Eloquent-heavy service with
~55 imports) is the most expensive single file encountered so far.
The per-collector timing is controlled by a `>= 2s` threshold in
`src/analyse.rs` Phase 2 (search for `⏱`). It prints a breakdown
like:

```
⏱  63.2s  src/core/Purchase/Services/PurchaseFileService.php
  [fast=1ms cls=40ms mem=23696ms fn=12ms unres=16781ms arg=22568ms impl=0ms depr=54ms]
