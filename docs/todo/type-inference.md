# PHPantom — Type Inference

Type resolution gaps: generic resolution, conditional return types,
type narrowing, PHP version features, and stub attribute handling.
Items that are purely about *completion UX* or *stub metadata
extraction* live in [completion.md](completion.md).

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

## T2. File system watching for vendor and project changes
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom loads Composer artifacts (classmap, PSR-4 mappings, autoload
files) once during `initialized` and caches them for the session. If
the user runs `composer update`, `composer require`, or `composer remove`
while the editor is open, the cached data goes stale. The user gets
completions and go-to-definition based on the old package versions
until they restart the editor.

### What to watch

| Path | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` | Changed | Reload classmap |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` | Changed | Reload PSR-4 mappings |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_files.php` | Changed | Re-scan autoload files for global functions/constants |
| `composer.json` | Changed | Reload project PSR-4 prefixes, re-check vendor dir |
| `composer.lock` | Changed | Good secondary signal that packages changed |

All three `autoload_*.php` files are rewritten atomically by Composer
on every `install`, `update`, `require`, `remove`, and `dump-autoload`.
Watching these is sufficient to catch any package change.

### Implementation options

1. **LSP `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`** — register file watchers
   via `client/registerCapability` during `initialized`. The editor
   handles the OS-level watching and sends notifications. This is the
   cleanest approach and works cross-platform. Register glob patterns
   for the vendor Composer files and `composer.json`.

2. **Server-side `notify` crate** — use the `notify` Rust crate to
   watch the file system directly. More control but adds a dependency
   and duplicates what the editor already provides.

Option 1 is preferred. The LSP spec's `DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions`
supports glob patterns like `**/vendor/composer/autoload_*.php`.

### Reload strategy

- On change notification, re-run the same parsing logic from
  `initialized` for the affected artifact.
- Invalidate `class_index` entries that came from vendor files (their
  parsed AST may have changed).
- Clear and re-populate `classmap` from the new `autoload_classmap.php`.
- Log the reload to the output panel so the user knows it happened.
- Debounce rapid changes (Composer writes multiple files in sequence)
  with a short delay (e.g. 500ms) to avoid redundant reloads.

### `textDocument/didSave` handler

PHPantom does not currently implement `textDocument/didSave`. This
means changes to files that are not open in the editor (e.g. files
saved by a script, a git checkout, or another tool) are invisible
until the file is opened. This is standard behaviour for most LSPs,
but it matters for the file-watching story: even after
`workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` is wired up for Composer artifacts,
changes to user PHP files made outside the editor (e.g. code
generation, `artisan make:model`) will not be picked up until the
file is opened.

When file system watching is implemented, consider also registering
a `didSave` handler (or a broad `*.php` watcher) to trigger a
targeted single-file rescan for files in PSR-4 directories, matching
the plan described in [indexing.md Phase 2](indexing.md#phase-2-staleness-detection-and-auto-refresh).

---

## T3. Property hooks (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHP 8.4 introduced property hooks (`get` / `set`):

```php
class User {
    public string $name {
        get => strtoupper($this->name);
        set => trim($value);
    }
}
```

The mago parser (v1.8) already produces `Property::Hooked` and
`PropertyHook` AST nodes, and the generic `.modifiers()`, `.hint()`,
`.variables()` methods mean hooked properties are extracted for basic
completion. However:

- **Hook bodies are never walked.** Variables and anonymous classes
  inside `get`/`set` bodies are invisible to resolution.
- **`$value` parameter** inside `set` hooks is not offered for
  variable completion.
- **Asymmetric visibility** (`public private(set) string $name`) is
  not recognised — the `set` visibility is ignored, so filtering
  may incorrectly allow setting a property that should be
  write-restricted.

**Fix:** In `extract_class_like_members`, match `Property::Hooked`
explicitly, walk hook bodies for anonymous classes and variable
scopes, and parse the set-visibility modifier into a new
`set_visibility` field on `PropertyInfo`.

### Asymmetric visibility (also PHP 8.4 / 8.5)

Separate from hooks, PHP 8.4 allows asymmetric visibility on plain
and promoted properties. PHP 8.5 extended this to static properties.

```php
class Settings {
    public private(set) string $name;

    public function __construct(
        public protected(set) int $retries = 3,
    ) {}
}
```

PHPantom currently extracts a single `Visibility` per property.
Completion filtering uses this to decide whether a property should
appear. A `public private(set)` property should appear for reading
from outside the class but not for assignment contexts.

Add an optional `set_visibility: Option<Visibility>` to
`PropertyInfo`. Populate it from the AST modifier list (the parser
exposes the set-visibility keyword). Completion filtering does not
currently distinguish read vs write contexts, so the immediate fix
is just to store the value; context-aware filtering can follow later.

This shares the same `set_visibility` field as the hooked-property
fix above, so both should be implemented together.

---

## T4. Non-empty-* type narrowing and propagation
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

PHPStan tracks `non-empty-string` and `non-empty-array` through
built-in functions. These narrowings don't directly enable
class-based completion, but they improve hover type display and
would catch bugs if we add diagnostics. All three sub-items share
the same implementation pattern (function-name-triggered type
narrowing in conditions or return types) and should be implemented
together.

**String containment narrowing.** When `str_contains($haystack,
$needle)` appears in a condition and `$needle` is known to be a
non-empty string, narrow `$haystack` to `non-empty-string`. Same
for `str_starts_with`, `str_ends_with`, `strpos`, `strrpos`,
`stripos`, `strripos`, `strstr`, and the `mb_*` equivalents.
See `StrContainingTypeSpecifyingExtension` in PHPStan.

**Count narrowing.** `if (count($arr) > 0)` or
`if (count($arr) >= 1)` narrows `$arr` to `non-empty-array`.
PHPStan handles a full matrix of comparison operators and integer
range types against `count()` / `sizeof()` calls. See
`CountFunctionTypeSpecifyingExtension`.

**String function propagation.** Passing a `non-empty-string` to
`addslashes()`, `urlencode()`, `htmlspecialchars()`,
`escapeshellarg()`, `escapeshellcmd()`, `preg_quote()`,
`rawurlencode()`, or `rawurldecode()` should return
`non-empty-string`. See `NonEmptyStringFunctionsReturnTypeExtension`.

---

## T5. Fiber type resolution
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

`Generator<TKey, TValue, TSend, TReturn>` has dedicated support for
extracting each type parameter (value type for foreach, send type
for `$var = yield`, return type for `getReturn()`). `Fiber` has no
equivalent handling — `Fiber::start()`, `Fiber::resume()`, and
`Fiber::getReturn()` don't resolve their generic types.

PHP userland rarely annotates Fiber with generics (unlike Generator),
so this is low priority. If demand appears, the fix would mirror the
Generator extraction in `docblock/types.rs`.

---

## T6. `Closure::bind()` / `Closure::fromCallable()` return type preservation
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Variables holding closure literals, arrow functions, and first-class
callables now resolve to the `Closure` class, so `$fn->bindTo()`,
`$fn->call()`, etc. offer completions.  The remaining gap is
*preserving the closure's callable signature* through `Closure::bind()`
and resolving `Closure::fromCallable('functionName')` to the actual
function's signature as a typed `Closure`.  This is relevant for DI
containers and middleware patterns but is a niche use case.

See `ClosureBindDynamicReturnTypeExtension` and
`ClosureFromCallableDynamicReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## T7. `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` resolution
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom already parses `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` as type keywords
but does not resolve them to concrete types. When `T` is bound to a
concrete array type, these utility types should resolve:

- `value-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `string|int`
- `key-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `'a'|'b'`
- `value-of<array<string, User>>` → `User`
- `key-of<array<string, User>>` → `string`

These types commonly appear in PHPStan-typed libraries and in
`@template` constraints. For example:

```php
/**
 * @template T of array
 * @param T $array
 * @return value-of<T>
 */
function first(array $array): mixed;
```

**Implementation:** plug into the generic substitution pipeline in
`inheritance.rs` / `completion/types/resolution.rs`. After template
parameters are substituted with concrete types, detect `key-of<...>`
and `value-of<...>` wrappers and resolve them by inspecting the inner
type:

- If the inner type is an `array{...}` shape, collect the key or value
  types from the shape fields.
- If the inner type is `array<K, V>`, extract `K` or `V` directly.
- If the inner type is still an unresolved template parameter, leave
  it as-is (it may resolve later in the chain).

---



## T9. Dead-code elimination after `never`-returning calls
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

When a function or method has return type `never`, any code path that
calls it is guaranteed to terminate. Variables assigned before the
`never` call in a conditional branch should not have their type
polluted by the branch's assignments.

```php
$x = 'hello';
if (rand(0,1)) {
    $x = 'other';
    abort(); // returns never
}
$x; // should be "hello", not "hello"|"other"
```

Today PHPantom's branch-merging logic unions all branch assignments
regardless of whether the branch terminates. Recognising `never` as a
terminating statement (alongside `return`, `throw`, `die`, `exit`)
would fix this.

**Fixture to activate:**

- `type/never_return_type.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `type/never.test`

---

## T10. Ternary expression as RHS of list destructuring
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

List destructuring (`[$a, $b] = expr`) resolves element types when
the RHS is a function call returning an array shape, or a simple
array literal. When the RHS is a ternary expression whose branches
are array literals or array-shape-returning calls, the resolver
doesn't drill into the branches to union the element types.

```php
[$a, $b] = $cond ? [new Foo(), new Bar()] : [new Bar(), new Foo()];
$a->  // should see Foo|Bar members
```

**Fixture to activate:**

- `assignment/list_destructuring_conditional.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `assignment/list_assignment.test`

---

## T11. Nested list destructuring
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Nested destructuring like `[[$one, $two]] = $source` is not resolved.
When the RHS has a type like `array{array{Foo, Bar}}`, the outer
destructuring peels the first dimension but the inner destructuring
doesn't resolve individual elements.

```php
/** @return array{array{Foo, Bar}} */
function getPair(): array { return [[new Foo(), new Bar()]]; }

[[$one, $two]] = getPair();
$one->  // should see Foo members
```

**Fixture to activate:**

- `assignment/nested_list_destructuring.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `assignment/list_desconstruct_nested.test`

---

## T12. Intersection types flattened to unions by `type_strings_joined`
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

`ResolvedType::type_strings_joined` joins all resolved type entries
with `|`. When a variable has an intersection type (`A&B`), the
resolution pipeline produces separate `ResolvedType` entries for each
part, and the join produces `A|B` instead of `A&B`.

This affects any consumer that reads the joined type string, including
hover display, extract function parameter types, and docblock
generation on extracted methods.

**Example:**

```php
function measure(Countable&Serializable $thing): void {
    // Select and extract:
    echo $thing->count();
}
// Extracted method gets `Countable|Serializable $thing` instead of
// `Countable&Serializable $thing`.
```

**Remaining work.** `PhpType::Intersection` already exists and
`ResolvedType::types_joined()` returns a structured `PhpType`, but
the resolution pipeline still produces separate `ResolvedType` entries
for each part of an intersection. The fix is to make the pipeline emit
a single `ResolvedType` with `PhpType::Intersection` when the source
type is an intersection.

**After fixing:** verify that extract function docblock generation
preserves intersection types in both the native hint and the `@param`
tag.

---

## T13. Closure variables lose callable signature detail
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a variable holds a closure or arrow function, the resolution
pipeline resolves it to the `Closure` class name. The callable
signature (parameter types, return type) is lost. This means:

1. Passing `$fn` to an extracted method produces `Closure $fn` with
   `@param (Closure(): mixed)` instead of the concrete signature.
2. An explicit `/** @var (Closure(int): string) $fn */` annotation
   is recognised by variable resolution (`find_var_raw_type_in_source`
   returns the annotated type), but `clean_type_for_signature` now
   correctly extracts `Closure` as the native hint. The raw type is
   preserved for docblock generation.

The remaining gap is that *unannotated* closures like
`$fn = function(int $x): string { ... }` resolve to bare `Closure`
with no signature detail. `extract_closure_return_type_from_assignment`
extracts the return type for call-site resolution, but does not
produce a full callable type string for variable-type contexts.

**Example:**

```php
$fn = function(int $x): string { return (string)$x; };
// Extracting code that uses $fn as a parameter produces:
//   @param (Closure(): mixed) $fn
// Instead of:
//   @param (Closure(int): string) $fn
```

**What needs to change:**

1. When resolving a variable whose assignment RHS is a closure or
   arrow function, build a callable type string from the literal's
   parameter list and return type hint (e.g. `(Closure(int): string)`).
   Return this as the variable's type string instead of bare `Closure`.

2. `clean_type_for_signature` already handles parenthesized callable
   types by extracting the base name (`Closure` or `callable`), so
   the native hint will be correct.

3. `enrichment_plain` should recognise that a raw type like
   `(Closure(int): string)` already carries a full signature and
   should not be re-enriched to `(Closure(): mixed)`.

**After fixing:** verify that extract function docblock generation
emits the concrete callable signature in the `@param` tag.

---

## T20. Type narrowing reconciliation engine
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: High**

PHPantom's type narrowing in `completion/types/narrowing.rs` handles
basic patterns (instanceof, is_* calls, null checks) but lacks the
algebraic framework that PHPStan and Psalm use. Key gaps:

1. No separate tracking of "sure types" vs "sure-not types". When
   `$x !== null`, PHPantom should remove `null` from the union
   (sure-not) rather than trying to intersect with "not-null".
2. No proper AND/OR algebra. `$a instanceof Foo && $b instanceof Bar`
   should union the narrowings in true context and intersect them in
   false context. Currently only simple cases work.
3. No truthy/falsey distinction. `if ($x)` (truthy) vs
   `if ($x === true)` (strict true) should produce different
   narrowings. PHPStan uses a 4-state bitmask context.
4. No assertion propagation from `@phpstan-assert` /
   `@psalm-assert` annotations on called functions. PHPantom parses
   these assertions but doesn't apply them as type narrowings at
   call sites.

**Design:** create a
`fn reconcile(existing: PhpType, assertion: Assertion, negated: bool) -> PhpType`
function that dispatches to per-assertion-kind narrowing logic. Start
with 15 core assertion kinds: IsType, IsNotType, IsNull, IsNotNull,
Truthy, Falsy, IsIdentical, IsNotIdentical, IsInstanceOf,
IsNotInstanceOf, HasMethod, HasProperty, IsGreaterThan, IsLessThan,
NonEmptyCountable.

**Reference:** Psalm has 41 assertion types under
`Psalm/Storage/Assertion/`. PHPStan's `TypeSpecifier` returns
`SpecifiedTypes` with dual sure/sureNot maps.

**Depends on:** T19 (structured types make reconciliation much
simpler, but basic reconciliation can work with strings too).

## T24. `stdClass` dynamic property access
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

`stdClass` is PHP's generic dynamic-property container. Accessing any
property on a value known to be `stdClass` (or narrowed to `object`
via `is_object()`) should not produce `unresolved_member_access`
diagnostics, because `stdClass` permits arbitrary properties by
design.

**Partially resolved.** Three changes landed:

1. `filter_type_by_guard` now narrows `mixed` → the canonical type
   for each guard kind (e.g. `is_object()` → `object`) instead of
   filtering `mixed` to empty.
2. `resolve_subject_outcome_variable` returns a synthetic
   `Resolved(stdClass)` when the resolved type is `object` or
   `stdClass`, so the existing `check_member_on_resolved_classes`
   suppression kicks in.
3. `try_apply_type_guard_narrowing` decomposes compound `&&`
   conditions so `if (is_object($x) && $x->prop)` narrows in both
   the condition RHS and the if-body. `apply_and_lhs_narrowing` also
   handles `is_object()` in `&&` inline narrowing.

This fixed `Order:646,647` (`json_decode` → `mixed` → `is_object`
guard → property access).

**Remaining:** `instanceof` narrowing on array element access
expressions (T20 concern). The narrowing system only matches bare
variable names (`$var`), not subscript expressions (`$arr[0]`).
The `PurchaseFileService` case that originally motivated this item
is now resolved by the `DB::select()` return type patch (B14) combined
with `stdClass` property access suppression, but the general gap
remains for any `$arr[$i] instanceof Foo` pattern.

---

## T25. Forward-walking scope model for variable type resolution
**Impact: High · Effort: Very High**

PHPantom resolves variable types lazily: when the user triggers
completion on `$x->`, it walks backward from the cursor to find
where `$x` was assigned, then recursively resolves any variables
referenced in the RHS. Each level of indirection adds a call to
`resolve_variable_types`, which re-parses the file and re-walks the
AST. A global depth counter (`MAX_VAR_RESOLUTION_DEPTH`, currently 4)
caps the recursion to prevent stack overflows.

PHPStan, Psalm, and Mago all use the opposite strategy: an eager,
single-pass, forward-walking scope model. They walk statements
top-to-bottom, carrying a mutable type map (`expressionTypes` in
PHPStan, `locals` in Mago). When they encounter `$a = $b->prop`,
they look up `$b` in the already-populated map, resolve the property,
and store `$a`'s type. Variable lookup is a flat O(1) map fetch with
zero recursion regardless of assignment chain depth.

The backward-scanning approach causes several problems:

- **Depth limit fragility.** Every real-world pattern that adds one
  more level of indirection (e.g. array shape literals referencing
  variables assigned from foreach bindings inside conditional
  branches) requires bumping the limit. The limit was 3, then 4;
  it will need to grow again.
- **Redundant work.** Each recursive call re-parses the source and
  re-walks the AST from the top. A forward pass would parse once and
  walk once.
- **No scope threading.** Narrowing, guard clauses, and branch-aware
  resolution are bolted on as post-hoc corrections rather than
  flowing naturally through the scope.

**Depth limits eliminated by this item:**

| Constant | Value | Location | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAX_VAR_RESOLUTION_DEPTH` | 4 | `completion/variable/resolution.rs` | Each variable in an assignment chain triggers a full re-parse and re-walk. Was 3, bumped to 4 for array shapes in conditional loop branches. |
| `MAX_CLOSURE_INFER_DEPTH` | 4 | `completion/variable/closure_resolution.rs` | `infer_callable_params_from_receiver` resolves the receiver type to infer closure parameter types, which can trigger another variable resolution cycle. |

Both share the same root cause: resolving a variable's type triggers
a full re-parse and re-walk from scratch, which recurses when the RHS
references another variable. In a forward-walking model, both would
be flat map lookups with zero recursion.

The remaining depth limits (`MAX_INHERITANCE_DEPTH`,
`MAX_TRAIT_DEPTH`, `MAX_MIXIN_DEPTH`, `MAX_ALIAS_DEPTH`) guard
against walking PHP class/type hierarchies and are unrelated to the
resolution architecture. They mirror limits that PHPStan and Mago
also have and should stay as-is.

A forward-walking scope model would:

1. Parse the enclosing function body once.
2. Walk statements in order, maintaining a `HashMap<VarName, PhpType>`
   scope that is updated on each assignment, foreach binding, catch
   clause, and narrowing point.
3. At the cursor position, read the variable's type from the map.

This eliminates the depth limit entirely and makes the resolution
cost proportional to the number of statements before the cursor,
not the depth of the assignment chain.

**Depends on:** T19 (structured type representation) should land
first so the scope map stores `PhpType` values instead of strings.

**Migration path:** Start with a parallel implementation behind a
feature flag. The existing backward-scanning resolver stays as a
fallback. Migrate one resolution context at a time (completion,
hover, diagnostics) once the forward walker covers enough cases.

**Reference:** PHPStan's `MutatingScope.expressionTypes` +
`NodeScopeResolver.processStmtNode`, Mago's `BlockContext.locals` +
statement analyzers. Both converge on the same architecture: the
scope is the single source of truth, populated eagerly as the walk
progresses.

---

## T26. Populate `ClassInfo` on return-type `ResolvedType`s
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

Multiple sites in `completion/variable/rhs_resolution.rs` resolve a
method or function return type and wrap it in
`ResolvedType::from_type_string(parsed_effective)`, even when the
`PhpType` names a class. This produces a `ResolvedType` with
`class_info: None`, forcing downstream consumers to either re-resolve
the type or silently miss it.

**Affected call sites** (all in `rhs_resolution.rs`): lines around
1283, 1363, 1491, 1539, 1728, 1911, 1958, 2031. Each resolves a
return type hint, gets a `PhpType` that may contain a class name
(e.g. `Collection<User>`), and creates a type-string-only
`ResolvedType`.

**Fix:** When the `PhpType` has a `base_name()` that resolves to a
known class, look up the `ClassInfo` and use
`ResolvedType::from_both(type_hint, class_info)` instead of
`from_type_string`. A helper like
`ResolvedType::from_type_with_lookup(php_type, class_loader)` could
centralise this pattern.

**After fixing:** downstream code that checks `rt.class_info` (hover,
narrowing, completion builder) will find populated class info without
a second resolution pass.

---

## T27. `from_class` loses generic parameters
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

`ResolvedType::from_class(class)` constructs the `type_string` as
`PhpType::Named(class.name.clone())`, discarding any generic
parameters the caller may know about. For example, if the caller
resolved `Collection<int, User>` to a `ClassInfo`, the resulting
`ResolvedType` stores `PhpType::Named("Collection")` instead of the
full parameterised type.

The `from_classes_with_hint` variant exists to preserve the original
`PhpType`, but `from_class` and `from_classes` (which calls
`from_class` in a loop) are still used by callers that have the
original type available upstream but do not thread it through.

**Fix:** Audit all callers of `from_class` and `from_classes`. Where
the original `PhpType` is available (or can be threaded through
cheaply), switch to `from_both` or `from_classes_with_hint`. Consider
deprecating the bare `from_class` constructor or adding a lint-level
comment discouraging its use when a type hint is available.

---

## T28. Centralise self-keyword string checks
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Approximately eight call sites across five files compare raw subject
expression strings against `"self"`, `"static"`, `"parent"`, and
`"$this"` with ad-hoc `==` checks:

- `completion/call_resolution.rs` (L1197, L1332-1342)
- `completion/handler.rs` (L849, L892)
- `completion/source/helpers.rs` (L413, L450, L664)
- `completion/variable/class_string_resolution.rs` (L187-197)
- `completion/types/conditional.rs` (L365-370)

`PhpType` already has `is_self_like()` and `is_self_ref()` methods
that handle this structurally, but the call sites operate on raw
subject strings, not parsed `PhpType` values.

**Fix:** Add a small shared utility (e.g. `fn is_self_keyword(s: &str)
-> bool` in `util.rs` or `names.rs`) that checks all four variants
case-insensitively. Replace the scattered inline comparisons with
calls to this helper. Alternatively, parse the subject text into a
`PhpType` at the call site boundary and use `is_self_like()`.

---

## T29. Replace hand-rolled expression parsing in `resolve_inline_arg_raw_type`
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

`resolve_inline_arg_raw_type` in `completion/call_resolution.rs`
(around L1319-1362) manually parses call and property chains from
text by splitting on `->` and `::` via `rfind`:

```rust
if let Some(pos) = call_body.rfind("->") {
    let base = &call_body[..pos];
    let base = base.strip_suffix('?').unwrap_or(base);
    let method_name = &call_body[pos + 2..];
    // ...
}
if let Some(pos) = call_body.rfind("::") {
    let class_part = &call_body[..pos];
    let method_name = &call_body[pos + 2..];
    // ...
}
```

`SubjectExpr::parse` already handles this structurally and is tested.

**Fix:** Replace the manual `rfind` splitting with
`SubjectExpr::parse(call_body)` and match on the resulting
`SubjectExpr::MethodCall` / `SubjectExpr::StaticMethodCall` /
`SubjectExpr::PropertyAccess` variants. This eliminates the
hand-rolled parsing and the keyword string comparisons that follow.

---

## T30. Narrowing helpers on `ResolvedType` to prevent field desync
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

Multiple functions in `completion/types/narrowing.rs` mutate
`rt.type_string` (e.g. stripping null, filtering by guard type) and
separately check or clear `rt.class_info`. Because the two fields are
updated independently, they can drift out of sync. For example, after
null-stripping, the `type_string` might change from `?Foo` to `Foo`
while `class_info` stays as-is (in practice `class_info` does not
track nullability, so this specific case is benign, but the pattern
is fragile).

**Fix:** Add helper methods on `ResolvedType` that keep both fields
consistent:

- `strip_null(&mut self)` — calls `non_null_type()` on `type_string`
  and preserves `class_info` (since null-stripping never invalidates
  the class).
- `filter_by_guard(&mut self, guard: &PhpType)` — filters
  `type_string` and clears `class_info` when the type no longer
  matches the original class.
- `replace_type(&mut self, new_type: PhpType)` — updates
  `type_string` and clears `class_info` when the type changes to
  something that does not match the existing class.

Then update the narrowing call sites to use these helpers instead of
reaching into the fields directly.

## T31. Eliminate minor string-to-PhpType round-trips
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

Several places construct a `PhpType` (or already have one) but
convert it back to a string unnecessarily, or use a string-accepting
API when a typed variant exists:

| Location | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| `code_actions/extract_constant.rs` L264-314 | `literal_type_name()` returns `&str` after calling `PhpType` predicates. Should return `Option<PhpType>` directly. |
| `virtual_members/laravel/factory.rs` L128-134 | Uses `MethodInfo::virtual_method(name, Some(&str))` instead of `virtual_method_typed(name, Some(&PhpType))`. |
| `docblock/virtual_members.rs` L226-237 | `parse_method_tag_params` creates an intermediate `Option<String>` that is parsed to `PhpType` a few lines later. Could parse directly. |
| `code_actions/phpstan/fix_return_type.rs` L1987-1995 | Extracts return type hint from source text via `find(':')` + split and compares against `"void"`. Could parse with `PhpType::parse()` and use `is_void()`. |

**Fix:** Address each site individually. These are small, isolated
changes that each remove one unnecessary string allocation or
round-trip.
