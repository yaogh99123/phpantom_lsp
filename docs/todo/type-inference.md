# PHPantom — Type Inference

Type resolution gaps: generic resolution, conditional return types,
type narrowing, PHP version features, and stub attribute handling.
Items that are purely about *completion UX* or *stub metadata
extraction* live in [completion.md](completion.md).

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

## T2. File system watching for vendor and project changes
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom loads Composer artifacts (classmap, PSR-4 mappings, autoload
files) once during `initialized` and caches them for the session. If
the user runs `composer update`, `composer require`, or `composer remove`
while the editor is open, the cached data goes stale. The user gets
completions and go-to-definition based on the old package versions
until they restart the editor.

### What to watch

| Path | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` | Changed | Reload classmap |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` | Changed | Reload PSR-4 mappings |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_files.php` | Changed | Re-scan autoload files for global functions/constants |
| `composer.json` | Changed | Reload project PSR-4 prefixes, re-check vendor dir |
| `composer.lock` | Changed | Good secondary signal that packages changed |

All three `autoload_*.php` files are rewritten atomically by Composer
on every `install`, `update`, `require`, `remove`, and `dump-autoload`.
Watching these is sufficient to catch any package change.

### Implementation options

1. **LSP `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`** — register file watchers
   via `client/registerCapability` during `initialized`. The editor
   handles the OS-level watching and sends notifications. This is the
   cleanest approach and works cross-platform. Register glob patterns
   for the vendor Composer files and `composer.json`.

2. **Server-side `notify` crate** — use the `notify` Rust crate to
   watch the file system directly. More control but adds a dependency
   and duplicates what the editor already provides.

Option 1 is preferred. The LSP spec's `DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions`
supports glob patterns like `**/vendor/composer/autoload_*.php`.

### Reload strategy

- On change notification, re-run the same parsing logic from
  `initialized` for the affected artifact.
- Invalidate `class_index` entries that came from vendor files (their
  parsed AST may have changed).
- Clear and re-populate `classmap` from the new `autoload_classmap.php`.
- Log the reload to the output panel so the user knows it happened.
- Debounce rapid changes (Composer writes multiple files in sequence)
  with a short delay (e.g. 500ms) to avoid redundant reloads.

### `textDocument/didSave` handler

PHPantom does not currently implement `textDocument/didSave`. This
means changes to files that are not open in the editor (e.g. files
saved by a script, a git checkout, or another tool) are invisible
until the file is opened. This is standard behaviour for most LSPs,
but it matters for the file-watching story: even after
`workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` is wired up for Composer artifacts,
changes to user PHP files made outside the editor (e.g. code
generation, `artisan make:model`) will not be picked up until the
file is opened.

When file system watching is implemented, consider also registering
a `didSave` handler (or a broad `*.php` watcher) to trigger a
targeted single-file rescan for files in PSR-4 directories, matching
the plan described in [indexing.md Phase 2](indexing.md#phase-2-staleness-detection-and-auto-refresh).

---

## T3. Property hooks (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHP 8.4 introduced property hooks (`get` / `set`):

```php
class User {
    public string $name {
        get => strtoupper($this->name);
        set => trim($value);
    }
}
```

The mago parser (v1.8) already produces `Property::Hooked` and
`PropertyHook` AST nodes, and the generic `.modifiers()`, `.hint()`,
`.variables()` methods mean hooked properties are extracted for basic
completion. However:

- **Hook bodies are never walked.** Variables and anonymous classes
  inside `get`/`set` bodies are invisible to resolution.
- **`$value` parameter** inside `set` hooks is not offered for
  variable completion.
- **Asymmetric visibility** (`public private(set) string $name`) is
  not recognised — the `set` visibility is ignored, so filtering
  may incorrectly allow setting a property that should be
  write-restricted.

**Fix:** In `extract_class_like_members`, match `Property::Hooked`
explicitly, walk hook bodies for anonymous classes and variable
scopes, and parse the set-visibility modifier into a new
`set_visibility` field on `PropertyInfo`.

### Asymmetric visibility (also PHP 8.4 / 8.5)

Separate from hooks, PHP 8.4 allows asymmetric visibility on plain
and promoted properties. PHP 8.5 extended this to static properties.

```php
class Settings {
    public private(set) string $name;

    public function __construct(
        public protected(set) int $retries = 3,
    ) {}
}
```

PHPantom currently extracts a single `Visibility` per property.
Completion filtering uses this to decide whether a property should
appear. A `public private(set)` property should appear for reading
from outside the class but not for assignment contexts.

Add an optional `set_visibility: Option<Visibility>` to
`PropertyInfo`. Populate it from the AST modifier list (the parser
exposes the set-visibility keyword). Completion filtering does not
currently distinguish read vs write contexts, so the immediate fix
is just to store the value; context-aware filtering can follow later.

This shares the same `set_visibility` field as the hooked-property
fix above, so both should be implemented together.

## T4. Non-empty-* type narrowing and propagation
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

PHPStan tracks `non-empty-string` and `non-empty-array` through
built-in functions. These narrowings don't directly enable
class-based completion, but they improve hover type display and
would catch bugs if we add diagnostics. All three sub-items share
the same implementation pattern (function-name-triggered type
narrowing in conditions or return types) and should be implemented
together.

**String containment narrowing.** When `str_contains($haystack,
$needle)` appears in a condition and `$needle` is known to be a
non-empty string, narrow `$haystack` to `non-empty-string`. Same
for `str_starts_with`, `str_ends_with`, `strpos`, `strrpos`,
`stripos`, `strripos`, `strstr`, and the `mb_*` equivalents.
See `StrContainingTypeSpecifyingExtension` in PHPStan.

**Count narrowing.** `if (count($arr) > 0)` or
`if (count($arr) >= 1)` narrows `$arr` to `non-empty-array`.
PHPStan handles a full matrix of comparison operators and integer
range types against `count()` / `sizeof()` calls. See
`CountFunctionTypeSpecifyingExtension`.

**String function propagation.** Passing a `non-empty-string` to
`addslashes()`, `urlencode()`, `htmlspecialchars()`,
`escapeshellarg()`, `escapeshellcmd()`, `preg_quote()`,
`rawurlencode()`, or `rawurldecode()` should return
`non-empty-string`. See `NonEmptyStringFunctionsReturnTypeExtension`.

---

## T5. Fiber type resolution
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

`Generator<TKey, TValue, TSend, TReturn>` has dedicated support for
extracting each type parameter (value type for foreach, send type
for `$var = yield`, return type for `getReturn()`). `Fiber` has no
equivalent handling — `Fiber::start()`, `Fiber::resume()`, and
`Fiber::getReturn()` don't resolve their generic types.

PHP userland rarely annotates Fiber with generics (unlike Generator),
so this is low priority. If demand appears, the fix would mirror the
Generator extraction in `docblock/types.rs`.

---

## T6. `Closure::bind()` / `Closure::fromCallable()` return type preservation
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Variables holding closure literals, arrow functions, and first-class
callables now resolve to the `Closure` class, so `$fn->bindTo()`,
`$fn->call()`, etc. offer completions.  The remaining gap is
*preserving the closure's callable signature* through `Closure::bind()`
and resolving `Closure::fromCallable('functionName')` to the actual
function's signature as a typed `Closure`.  This is relevant for DI
containers and middleware patterns but is a niche use case.

See `ClosureBindDynamicReturnTypeExtension` and
`ClosureFromCallableDynamicReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## T7. `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` resolution
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom already parses `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` as type keywords
but does not resolve them to concrete types. When `T` is bound to a
concrete array type, these utility types should resolve:

- `value-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `string|int`
- `key-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `'a'|'b'`
- `value-of<array<string, User>>` → `User`
- `key-of<array<string, User>>` → `string`

These types commonly appear in PHPStan-typed libraries and in
`@template` constraints. For example:

```php
/**
 * @template T of array
 * @param T $array
 * @return value-of<T>
 */
function first(array $array): mixed;
```

**Implementation:** plug into the generic substitution pipeline in
`inheritance.rs` / `completion/types/resolution.rs`. After template
parameters are substituted with concrete types, detect `key-of<...>`
and `value-of<...>` wrappers and resolve them by inspecting the inner
type:

- If the inner type is an `array{...}` shape, collect the key or value
  types from the shape fields.
- If the inner type is `array<K, V>`, extract `K` or `V` directly.
- If the inner type is still an unresolved template parameter, leave
  it as-is (it may resolve later in the chain).

## T9. Dead-code elimination after `never`-returning calls
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

When a function or method has return type `never`, any code path that
calls it is guaranteed to terminate. Variables assigned before the
`never` call in a conditional branch should not have their type
polluted by the branch's assignments.

```php
$x = 'hello';
if (rand(0,1)) {
    $x = 'other';
    abort(); // returns never
}
$x; // should be "hello", not "hello"|"other"
```

Today PHPantom's branch-merging logic unions all branch assignments
regardless of whether the branch terminates. Recognising `never` as a
terminating statement (alongside `return`, `throw`, `die`, `exit`)
would fix this.

**Fixture to activate:**

- `type/never_return_type.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `type/never.test`

## T10. Ternary expression as RHS of list destructuring
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

List destructuring (`[$a, $b] = expr`) resolves element types when
the RHS is a function call returning an array shape, or a simple
array literal. When the RHS is a ternary expression whose branches
are array literals or array-shape-returning calls, the resolver
doesn't drill into the branches to union the element types.

```php
[$a, $b] = $cond ? [new Foo(), new Bar()] : [new Bar(), new Foo()];
$a->  // should see Foo|Bar members
```

**Fixture to activate:**

- `assignment/list_destructuring_conditional.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `assignment/list_assignment.test`

---

## T11. Nested list destructuring
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Nested destructuring like `[[$one, $two]] = $source` is not resolved.
When the RHS has a type like `array{array{Foo, Bar}}`, the outer
destructuring peels the first dimension but the inner destructuring
doesn't resolve individual elements.

```php
/** @return array{array{Foo, Bar}} */
function getPair(): array { return [[new Foo(), new Bar()]]; }

[[$one, $two]] = getPair();
$one->  // should see Foo members
```

**Fixture to activate:**

- `assignment/nested_list_destructuring.fixture`

**phpactor ref:** `assignment/list_desconstruct_nested.test`

---

## T12. Intersection types flattened to unions by `type_strings_joined`
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low (after M4)**

`ResolvedType::type_strings_joined` joins all resolved type entries
with `|`. When a variable has an intersection type (`A&B`), the
resolution pipeline produces separate `ResolvedType` entries for each
part, and the join produces `A|B` instead of `A&B`.

This affects any consumer that reads the joined type string, including
hover display, extract function parameter types, and docblock
generation on extracted methods.

**Example:**

```php
function measure(Countable&Serializable $thing): void {
    // Select and extract:
    echo $thing->count();
}
// Extracted method gets `Countable|Serializable $thing` instead of
// `Countable&Serializable $thing`.
```

**Blocked by M4.** The fix requires `PhpType::Intersection` from the
mago-type-syntax migration. The current `Vec<ResolvedType>` has no way
to distinguish "these types form an intersection" from "these types
form a union". With `PhpType`, the intersection is a single tree node.

**After fixing:** verify that extract function docblock generation
preserves intersection types in both the native hint and the `@param`
tag.

---

## T13. Closure variables lose callable signature detail
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a variable holds a closure or arrow function, the resolution
pipeline resolves it to the `Closure` class name. The callable
signature (parameter types, return type) is lost. This means:

1. Passing `$fn` to an extracted method produces `Closure $fn` with
   `@param (Closure(): mixed)` instead of the concrete signature.
2. An explicit `/** @var (Closure(int): string) $fn */` annotation
   is recognised by variable resolution (`find_var_raw_type_in_source`
   returns the annotated type), but `clean_type_for_signature` now
   correctly extracts `Closure` as the native hint. The raw type is
   preserved for docblock generation.

The remaining gap is that *unannotated* closures like
`$fn = function(int $x): string { ... }` resolve to bare `Closure`
with no signature detail. `extract_closure_return_type_from_assignment`
extracts the return type for call-site resolution, but does not
produce a full callable type string for variable-type contexts.

**Example:**

```php
$fn = function(int $x): string { return (string)$x; };
// Extracting code that uses $fn as a parameter produces:
//   @param (Closure(): mixed) $fn
// Instead of:
//   @param (Closure(int): string) $fn
```

**What needs to change:**

1. When resolving a variable whose assignment RHS is a closure or
   arrow function, build a callable type string from the literal's
   parameter list and return type hint (e.g. `(Closure(int): string)`).
   Return this as the variable's type string instead of bare `Closure`.

2. `clean_type_for_signature` already handles parenthesized callable
   types by extracting the base name (`Closure` or `callable`), so
   the native hint will be correct.

3. `enrichment_plain` should recognise that a raw type like
   `(Closure(int): string)` already carries a full signature and
   should not be re-enriched to `(Closure(): mixed)`.

**After fixing:** verify that extract function docblock generation
emits the concrete callable signature in the `@param` tag.

---

## T18. Method-level template parameter resolution at call sites
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a method declares `@template T of SomeType` and uses `T` as both
a parameter and return type, PHPantom should resolve `T` to the
concrete type of the argument passed at the call site. Currently,
the template parameter name (e.g. `T`, `TRelation`) is left as the
resolved type string, and member access on the return value fails
with "subject type 'T' could not be resolved".

**Reproducer:**

```php
class ProductRepository
{
    /**
     * @template T of Builder|QueryBuilder
     * @param T $query
     * @return T
     */
    private static function filterDisabled(BuilderContract $query, Country $code): BuilderContract
    {
        $query->where(...);  // "subject type 'T' could not be resolved"
        return $query;
    }
}
```

```php
trait GetMarketTrait
{
    /**
     * @template TRelation of Relation
     * @param TRelation $relation
     * @return TRelation
     */
    protected function whereCurrentMarket(Relation $relation): Relation
    {
        $relation->getQuery()->where(...);
        // "subject type 'TRelation' could not be resolved"
    }
}
```

**What should work:** Inside the method body, `$query` should be
resolved using the `@template` bound (`Builder|QueryBuilder`) rather
than the bare template name. At call sites, `T` should be substituted
with the concrete argument type.

**Where to fix:**
- `src/completion/variable/resolution.rs` — when resolving a parameter
  variable, check for `@template` annotations that bind the parameter
  type and use the bound type (or concrete call-site type) instead of
  the raw template name.
- `src/completion/resolver.rs` — may need method-level template
  substitution logic similar to class-level generic substitution.

**Impact in shared codebase:** ~2 diagnostics.

---

## T19. Structured type representation
**Impact: High · Effort: Very High**

PHPantom represents types as strings (e.g. `"Collection<string>|null"`)
and manipulates them via string splitting, regex, and concatenation.
PHPStan, Psalm, and Mago all use structured type trees (enums/classes)
where each type is a node with typed children. This causes:

- Fragile parsing on every type comparison or manipulation
- No proper subtype checking (can't answer "is `Cat` a subtype of
  `Animal`?")
- String-based template substitution that breaks on nested generics
- No union simplification (`string|string` stays as-is, `true|false`
  doesn't merge to `bool`)
- Intersection types can't be properly distributed over unions

A structured type representation (a Rust `enum PhpType`) would
eliminate these issues. PHPantom already has `PhpType` via
`mago-type-syntax` for parsing. The gap is using it as the primary
representation throughout the resolution pipeline instead of raw
strings.

**Migration path:** incremental. Start by making the hottest paths
(template substitution, type narrowing) operate on `PhpType` values
instead of strings, converting at the boundary. Expand outward over
time.

**Reference:** PHPStan's `Type` interface (~120 methods), Psalm's
`Union`/`Atomic` hierarchy, Mago's `TUnion`/`TAtomic` enum. All three
converge on the same architecture.

**Note:** the `mago-type-syntax` integration tracked in `refactor.md`
is a stepping stone toward this. The remaining items there
(`ArrayShapeEntry.value_type` to `PhpType`, `split_type_token`
replacement) should be completed first.

---

## T20. Type narrowing reconciliation engine
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: High**

PHPantom's type narrowing in `completion/types/narrowing.rs` handles
basic patterns (instanceof, is_* calls, null checks) but lacks the
algebraic framework that PHPStan and Psalm use. Key gaps:

1. No separate tracking of "sure types" vs "sure-not types". When
   `$x !== null`, PHPantom should remove `null` from the union
   (sure-not) rather than trying to intersect with "not-null".
2. No proper AND/OR algebra. `$a instanceof Foo && $b instanceof Bar`
   should union the narrowings in true context and intersect them in
   false context. Currently only simple cases work.
3. No truthy/falsey distinction. `if ($x)` (truthy) vs
   `if ($x === true)` (strict true) should produce different
   narrowings. PHPStan uses a 4-state bitmask context.
4. No assertion propagation from `@phpstan-assert` /
   `@psalm-assert` annotations on called functions. PHPantom parses
   these assertions but doesn't apply them as type narrowings at
   call sites.

**Design:** create a
`fn reconcile(existing: PhpType, assertion: Assertion, negated: bool) -> PhpType`
function that dispatches to per-assertion-kind narrowing logic. Start
with 15 core assertion kinds: IsType, IsNotType, IsNull, IsNotNull,
Truthy, Falsy, IsIdentical, IsNotIdentical, IsInstanceOf,
IsNotInstanceOf, HasMethod, HasProperty, IsGreaterThan, IsLessThan,
NonEmptyCountable.

**Reference:** Psalm has 41 assertion types under
`Psalm/Storage/Assertion/`. PHPStan's `TypeSpecifier` returns
`SpecifiedTypes` with dual sure/sureNot maps.

**Depends on:** T19 (structured types make reconciliation much
simpler, but basic reconciliation can work with strings too).

---

## T21. Bidirectional template inference (upper/lower bounds)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

PHPantom's template resolution only tracks one direction: matching
template parameters against concrete types from extends clauses and
direct argument positions. PHPStan and Psalm track both upper bounds
(covariant positions like return types) and lower bounds (contravariant
positions like parameter types).

Key gaps:

1. When `@param Closure(T): void $callback` receives a closure, `T`
   should be inferred from the closure's parameter type
   (contravariant).
2. When multiple bounds exist for the same template, the most specific
   one should win. Psalm uses `appearance_depth` to prefer direct
   bindings over nested ones.
3. No variance tracking. `@template-covariant T` vs `@template T`
   affects whether `Container<Cat>` is assignable to
   `Container<Animal>`.

**Implementation:** add a `TemplateResolution` struct that accumulates
lower and upper bounds during call-site analysis, with a `resolve()`
method that picks the most specific bound.
