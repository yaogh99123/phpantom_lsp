# PHPantom — Type Inference & Resolution

This document covers type resolution gaps: generic resolution, conditional
return types, type narrowing, PHP version features, and stub attribute
handling. Items that are purely about *completion UX* or *stub metadata
extraction* live in [todo-completion.md](todo-completion.md).

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

| Label | Scale |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | **Critical**, **High**, **Medium-High**, **Medium**, **Low-Medium**, **Low** |
| **Effort** | **Low** (≤ 1 day), **Medium** (2-5 days), **Medium-High** (1-2 weeks), **High** (2-4 weeks), **Very High** (> 1 month) |

## 1. Pipe operator (PHP 8.5)
**Impact: High · Effort: Low**

PHP 8.5 introduced the pipe operator (`|>`):

```php
$result = $input
    |> htmlspecialchars(...)
    |> strtoupper(...)
    |> fn($s) => "<b>$s</b>";
```

The mago parser already produces `Expression::Pipe` nodes, and the
closure resolution module walks into pipe sub-expressions to find
closures. However, **no type resolution** is performed for the pipe
result — the RHS callable's return type is never resolved, so
`$result->` after a pipe chain produces no completions.

**Fix:** In `resolve_rhs_expression`, add a `Expression::Pipe` arm
that resolves the RHS callable (function reference, closure, or
arrow function) and returns its return type. For first-class
callable syntax (`htmlspecialchars(...)`), reuse the existing
`extract_first_class_callable_return_type` logic.

---

## 3. Parse and resolve `($param is T ? A : B)` return types
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

PHPStan's stubs use conditional return type syntax in docblocks:

```php
/**
 * @return ($value is string ? true : false)
 */
function is_string(mixed $value): bool {}
```

This is the mechanism behind all `is_*` function type narrowing in
PHPStan — the stubs declare the conditional, and the type specifier
reads it.  If we parse this syntax from stubs and `@return` tags, we
get type narrowing for `is_string`, `is_int`, `is_array`,
`is_object`, `is_null`, `is_bool`, `is_float`, `is_numeric`,
`is_scalar`, `is_callable`, `is_iterable`, `is_countable`, and
`is_resource` from annotations alone, without any hard-coded function
list.

The syntax also appears in userland code (PHPStan and Psalm both
support it), and in array function stubs:

```php
/**
 * @return ($array is non-empty-array ? non-empty-list<T> : list<T>)
 */
function array_values(array $array): array {}
```

**Implementation:** Extend the return type parser in
`docblock/types.rs` to recognise the `($paramName is Type ? A : B)`
pattern.  At call sites, check the argument's type against the
condition and select the appropriate branch.  This could reuse or
extend the existing `ConditionalReturnType` infrastructure.

---

## 4. Inherited docblock type propagation
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

When a child class overrides a method from a parent class or interface,
the ancestor's richer docblock types should flow down unconditionally.
Inheritance is the default — if the ancestor says `@return list<Pen>`
and the child just says `: array`, the resolved return type must be
`list<Pen>`. There is no opt-in; `@inheritDoc` is functionally
meaningless because a child that can run code already has the parent's
contract. The only thing that *blocks* inheritance is the child
providing its own docblock type that is equally or more specific.

**Example:**

```php
interface PenHolder {
    /** @return list<Pen> */
    public function getPens(): array;
}

class Drawer implements PenHolder {
    // No docblock — native return type is just `array`.
    public function getPens(): array { return []; }
}

$d = new Drawer();
$d->getPens()[0]-> // ← should complete Pen members
```

Today `Drawer::getPens()` resolves to `return_type: "array"` because
the method's own docblock has no `@return` tag and the native hint is
`array`. The interface's `@return list<Pen>` is never consulted.

**Root cause:** `resolve_class_with_inheritance` (inheritance.rs L155)
and `resolve_class_fully_inner` (virtual_members/mod.rs L360) both
skip a parent/interface method when the child already declares one
with the same name — the child wins unconditionally. No fallback
check compares the richness of the return type.

**What needs to change:**

1. **During inheritance merging** (`resolve_class_with_inheritance`):
   when the child already has a method with the same name, don't
   just skip — enrich it. If the child's `return_type` equals its
   `native_return_type` (i.e. no docblock refined it) and the
   ancestor's `return_type` differs from its `native_return_type`
   (i.e. the ancestor *does* have a richer docblock type), copy the
   ancestor's `return_type` onto the child's method. Do the same
   for each parameter's `type_hint` when the child's matches its
   `native_type_hint`. Also inherit `description` and
   `return_description` when the child lacks them.

2. **During interface merging** (`resolve_class_fully_inner`): same
   logic — when an interface method is skipped because the class
   already defines it, enrich the existing method with the
   interface's richer types and descriptions.

3. **Child docblock wins when present.** If the child provides its
   own `@return` or `@param` type (even if less specific), that is
   an intentional override and the ancestor type is not propagated.
   The test is simple: does the child's effective type differ from
   its native type? If yes, the child wrote a docblock — respect it.

**Scope of the fix:** This affects completion (return type drives
chain resolution), hover (return type displayed), and signature help
(parameter types shown). All three automatically benefit once the
merged `MethodInfo` carries the richer type.

**Properties too:** The same pattern applies to properties. An
interface declaring `@property-read list<Pen> $pens` should
propagate to an implementing class's `$pens` property if the class
only has a native `array` type hint.

---

## 5. File system watching for vendor and project changes
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom loads Composer artifacts (classmap, PSR-4 mappings, autoload
files) once during `initialized` and caches them for the session. If
the user runs `composer update`, `composer require`, or `composer remove`
while the editor is open, the cached data goes stale. The user gets
completions and go-to-definition based on the old package versions
until they restart the editor.

### What to watch

| Path | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` | Changed | Reload classmap |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` | Changed | Reload PSR-4 mappings |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_files.php` | Changed | Re-scan autoload files for global functions/constants |
| `composer.json` | Changed | Reload project PSR-4 prefixes, re-check vendor dir |
| `composer.lock` | Changed | Good secondary signal that packages changed |

All three `autoload_*.php` files are rewritten atomically by Composer
on every `install`, `update`, `require`, `remove`, and `dump-autoload`.
Watching these is sufficient to catch any package change.

### Implementation options

1. **LSP `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`** — register file watchers
   via `client/registerCapability` during `initialized`. The editor
   handles the OS-level watching and sends notifications. This is the
   cleanest approach and works cross-platform. Register glob patterns
   for the vendor Composer files and `composer.json`.

2. **Server-side `notify` crate** — use the `notify` Rust crate to
   watch the file system directly. More control but adds a dependency
   and duplicates what the editor already provides.

Option 1 is preferred. The LSP spec's `DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions`
supports glob patterns like `**/vendor/composer/autoload_*.php`.

### Reload strategy

- On change notification, re-run the same parsing logic from
  `initialized` for the affected artifact.
- Invalidate `class_index` entries that came from vendor files (their
  parsed AST may have changed).
- Clear and re-populate `classmap` from the new `autoload_classmap.php`.
- Log the reload to the output panel so the user knows it happened.
- Debounce rapid changes (Composer writes multiple files in sequence)
  with a short delay (e.g. 500ms) to avoid redundant reloads.

---

## 6. Property hooks (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHP 8.4 introduced property hooks (`get` / `set`):

```php
class User {
    public string $name {
        get => strtoupper($this->name);
        set => trim($value);
    }
}
```

The mago parser (v1.8) already produces `Property::Hooked` and
`PropertyHook` AST nodes, and the generic `.modifiers()`, `.hint()`,
`.variables()` methods mean hooked properties are extracted for basic
completion. However:

- **Hook bodies are never walked.** Variables and anonymous classes
  inside `get`/`set` bodies are invisible to resolution.
- **`$value` parameter** inside `set` hooks is not offered for
  variable completion.
- **Asymmetric visibility** (`public private(set) string $name`) is
  not recognised — the `set` visibility is ignored, so filtering
  may incorrectly allow setting a property that should be
  write-restricted.

**Fix:** In `extract_class_like_members`, match `Property::Hooked`
explicitly, walk hook bodies for anonymous classes and variable
scopes, and parse the set-visibility modifier into a new
`set_visibility` field on `PropertyInfo`.

---

## 7. Narrow types of `&$var` parameters after function calls
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a function takes a parameter by reference, the variable's type
after the call should reflect what the function writes to it.  PHPStan
has `FunctionParameterOutTypeExtension` for this.

Key examples:

| Function | Parameter | Type after call |
|---|---|---|
| `preg_match($pattern, $subject, &$matches)` | `$matches` | Typed array shape based on the regex |
| `preg_match_all($pattern, $subject, &$matches)` | `$matches` | Nested typed array based on the regex |
| `parse_str($string, &$result)` | `$result` | `array<string, string>` |
| `sscanf($string, $format, &...$vars)` | `$vars` | Types based on format specifiers |

The most impactful case is `preg_match` — PHPStan's
`RegexArrayShapeMatcher` parses the regex pattern to produce a precise
array shape for `$matches`, including named capture groups.  A simpler
first step would be to just type `$matches` as `array<int|string,
string>` when passed to `preg_match`.

**Implementation:** When resolving a variable's type after a function
call where the variable was passed by reference, look up the
function's parameter annotations for `@param-out` tags (PHPStan/Psalm
extension) or use a built-in map for known functions.

---

## 8. SPL iterator generic stubs
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPStan's `iterable.stub` provides full `@template TKey` /
`@template TValue` annotations for the entire SPL iterator hierarchy:
`ArrayIterator`, `FilterIterator`, `LimitIterator`,
`CachingIterator`, `RegexIterator`, `NoRewindIterator`,
`InfiniteIterator`, `AppendIterator`, `IteratorIterator`,
`RecursiveIteratorIterator`, `CallbackFilterIterator`, and more.

This means `foreach` over any SPL iterator properly resolves element
types.  If we rely on php-stubs for these classes, we are almost
certainly missing these generic annotations.  We should either:

- Ship our own stub overlays for the SPL iterator classes with
  `@template` annotations (like PHPStan does), or
- Detect and use PHPStan's stubs when present in the project's
  vendor directory.

---

## 9. Asymmetric visibility (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Separate from property hooks, PHP 8.4 allows asymmetric visibility on
plain and promoted properties. PHP 8.5 extended this to static
properties as well.

```php
class Settings {
    public private(set) string $name;

    public function __construct(
        public protected(set) int $retries = 3,
    ) {}
}
```

PHPantom currently extracts a single `Visibility` per property.
Completion filtering uses this to decide whether a property should
appear. A `public private(set)` property should appear for reading
from outside the class but not for assignment contexts.

**Fix:** Add an optional `set_visibility: Option<Visibility>` to
`PropertyInfo`. Populate it from the AST modifier list (the parser
exposes the set-visibility keyword). Completion filtering does not
currently distinguish read vs write contexts, so the immediate fix
is just to store the value; context-aware filtering can follow later.

---

## 10. `str_contains` / `str_starts_with` / `str_ends_with` → non-empty-string narrowing
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

When `str_contains($haystack, $needle)` appears in a condition and
`$needle` is known to be a non-empty string, PHPStan narrows
`$haystack` to `non-empty-string`.  The same applies to
`str_starts_with`, `str_ends_with`, `strpos`, `strrpos`, `stripos`,
`strripos`, `strstr`, and the `mb_*` equivalents.

This is lower priority for an LSP because `non-empty-string` does
not directly enable class-based completion, but it would improve
hover type display and catch bugs if we ever add diagnostics.

See `StrContainingTypeSpecifyingExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## 11. `count` / `sizeof` comparison → non-empty-array narrowing
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

`if (count($arr) > 0)` or `if (count($arr) >= 1)` narrows `$arr` to
a non-empty-array.  PHPStan handles a full matrix of comparison
operators and integer range types against `count()` / `sizeof()` calls.

See `CountFunctionTypeSpecifyingExtension` and the count-related
branches in `TypeSpecifier::specifyTypesInCondition`.

---

## 12. Fiber type resolution
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

`Generator<TKey, TValue, TSend, TReturn>` has dedicated support for
extracting each type parameter (value type for foreach, send type
for `$var = yield`, return type for `getReturn()`). `Fiber` has no
equivalent handling — `Fiber::start()`, `Fiber::resume()`, and
`Fiber::getReturn()` don't resolve their generic types.

PHP userland rarely annotates Fiber with generics (unlike Generator),
so this is low priority. If demand appears, the fix would mirror the
Generator extraction in `docblock/types.rs`.

---

## 13. Non-empty-string propagation through string functions
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

PHPStan tracks `non-empty-string` through string-manipulating
functions.  If you pass a `non-empty-string` to `addslashes()`,
`urlencode()`, `htmlspecialchars()`, `escapeshellarg()`,
`escapeshellcmd()`, `preg_quote()`, `rawurlencode()`, or
`rawurldecode()`, the return type is also `non-empty-string`.

This is low priority for an LSP because the narrower string type
does not directly enable class-based completion.  However, if we
ever add hover type display or diagnostics, this information
would improve accuracy.

See `NonEmptyStringFunctionsReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## 14. `Closure::bind()` / `Closure::fromCallable()` return type preservation
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Variables holding closure literals, arrow functions, and first-class
callables now resolve to the `Closure` class, so `$fn->bindTo()`,
`$fn->call()`, etc. offer completions.  The remaining gap is
*preserving the closure's callable signature* through `Closure::bind()`
and resolving `Closure::fromCallable('functionName')` to the actual
function's signature as a typed `Closure`.  This is relevant for DI
containers and middleware patterns but is a niche use case.

See `ClosureBindDynamicReturnTypeExtension` and
`ClosureFromCallableDynamicReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

## 15. `@param-closure-this`
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

The `@param-closure-this` PHPDoc tag declares what `$this` refers to
inside a closure parameter. This is critical for frameworks like Laravel
where closures are commonly rebound via `Closure::bindTo()`:

```php
/**
 * @param-closure-this \Illuminate\Routing\Route $callback
 */
function group(Closure $callback): void;
```

Without this, `$this->` inside the closure body produces no completions.
Laravel's routing (`Route::group`), testing (`$this->get(...)` inside
test closures), and macro APIs all rely on closure rebinding.

**Implementation:**

1. **Docblock parsing** — recognise `@param-closure-this` in
   `docblock/tags.rs`. The tag format is
   `@param-closure-this TypeName $paramName`. Extract the type string
   and the parameter name it applies to.

2. **Store on `ParameterInfo`** — add an optional `closure_this_type:
   Option<String>` field to `ParameterInfo`. During function/method
   extraction, if the docblock contains `@param-closure-this` for a
   parameter, populate this field.

3. **Closure `$this` resolution** — when resolving `$this` inside a
   closure body, check whether the closure is passed as an argument to
   a function/method call. If so, resolve the receiving function,
   find the target parameter, and check for `closure_this_type`. If
   present, use that type instead of the lexical `$this` class.

4. **Interaction with `Closure::bind()`** — this tag is the static
   analysis equivalent of runtime `Closure::bindTo()`. The two
   features are complementary: `@param-closure-this` handles the
   common case where the rebinding happens inside the called function,
   while `Closure::bind()` support (§14) handles explicit user-side
   rebinding.

---

## 16. `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` resolution
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom already parses `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` as type keywords
but does not resolve them to concrete types. When `T` is bound to a
concrete array type, these utility types should resolve:

- `value-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `string|int`
- `key-of<array{a: string, b: int}>` → `'a'|'b'`
- `value-of<array<string, User>>` → `User`
- `key-of<array<string, User>>` → `string`

These types commonly appear in PHPStan-typed libraries and in
`@template` constraints. For example:

```php
/**
 * @template T of array
 * @param T $array
 * @return value-of<T>
 */
function first(array $array): mixed;
```

**Implementation:** plug into the generic substitution pipeline in
`inheritance.rs` / `completion/types/resolution.rs`. After template
parameters are substituted with concrete types, detect `key-of<...>`
and `value-of<...>` wrappers and resolve them by inspecting the inner
type:

- If the inner type is an `array{...}` shape, collect the key or value
  types from the shape fields.
- If the inner type is `array<K, V>`, extract `K` or `V` directly.
- If the inner type is still an unresolved template parameter, leave
  it as-is (it may resolve later in the chain).

---


## 19. Negated `@phpstan-assert !Type`
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low-Medium**

When a function declares `@phpstan-assert !Foo $param`, calling it
should remove `Foo` from the variable's union type. Today the negation
prefix is not parsed, so the assertion is either ignored or
misinterpreted as a positive assertion.

**Discovered via:** fixture conversion (phpstan_assert_negated).

---

## 20. Generic `@phpstan-assert` with `class-string<T>` parameter inference
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

When a function declares `@phpstan-assert T $value` with a
`@template T` bound via a `class-string<T>` parameter, the narrowed
type should be inferred from the class-string argument at the call
site. For example:

```php
/**
 * @template T of object
 * @param class-string<T> $class
 * @phpstan-assert T $value
 */
function assertInstanceOf(string $class, mixed $value): void {}

assertInstanceOf(Foo::class, $x);
$x->fooMethod(); // $x should be narrowed to Foo
```

**Discovered via:** fixture conversion (phpstan_assert_generic).

---

## 21. Property-level narrowing
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

`$this->prop instanceof Foo` inside an `if` block does not narrow the
type of `$this->prop` for subsequent member access. Only local
variables participate in narrowing today.

**Discovered via:** fixture conversion (property_narrowing,
property_narrowing_negated, combination/property_instanceof).

---

## 25. `class-string<T>` on interface method not inherited
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When an interface method uses `class-string<T>` in its return type
and a class implements that interface, the implementing class's method
does not inherit the generic return type. The `class-string<T>`
pattern works on the interface directly but is lost during
inheritance merging.

**Discovered via:** fixture conversion (class_string_generic_interface).

---


## 27. `new $classStringVar` and `$classStringVar::staticMethod()`
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a variable holds a `class-string<T>`, `new $var` should resolve
to `T` and `$var::staticMethod()` should resolve through `T`'s static
methods. Neither path is supported today.

**Discovered via:** fixture conversion (type/class_string_new,
type/class_string_static_call).

---

## 28. `__invoke()` return type resolution
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Calling an object as a function (`$obj()`) does not resolve the return
type from the object's `__invoke()` method. The call expression path
does not check for `__invoke` when the callee is a variable holding
an object type.

**Discovered via:** fixture conversion (call_expression/invoke_return_type).

---

## 30. Invoked closure/arrow function return type
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Immediately invoked closures and arrow functions do not resolve their
return type:

```php
$result = (fn(): Foo => new Foo())();
$result->method(); // unresolved
```

The call expression resolution does not detect that the callee is a
parenthesized closure/arrow function expression.

**Discovered via:** fixture conversion (call_expression/arrow_fn_invocation).

---

## 31. Resolved-class cache: key by FQN + generic args (done)
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

The `resolved_class_cache` is now keyed by `(String, Vec<String>)`
(FQN + concrete generic type arguments) instead of bare FQN. This
eliminates the "cache poisoning" bug where `Builder<User>` and
`Builder<Post>` shared a single cache entry and the first resolution
won.

### What was done

1. `ResolvedClassCacheKey` is now `(String, Vec<String>)` where the
   second element is the concrete type argument list. For non-generic
   classes the list is empty, keeping the common case cheap.
2. `resolve_class_fully_inner` accepts a `generic_args: &[String]`
   parameter that is threaded into the cache key.
3. Cache store, lookup, and eviction all use the compound key.
4. `evict_fqn()` removes all entries matching a FQN regardless of
   generic args, used during targeted invalidation.

### What was NOT done (and why)

`build_builder_forwarded_methods` still uses the uncached
`resolve_class_fully` for the base Builder. The Builder resolved
inside the provider has empty generic args (it is the base class
before model-specific substitution). If cached under
`("Builder", [])`, later code paths that call
`resolve_class_fully_cached` on a Builder candidate (e.g.
`build_union_completion_items`) retrieve this pre-scope-injection
version, losing model-specific scope methods. Scope injection is
model-dependent and happens at a higher layer
(`try_inject_builder_scopes` in type resolution), so the base
Builder must not be cached inside the provider.

The "check candidate first" workarounds in `hover/mod.rs`,
`call_resolution.rs`, and `diagnostics/deprecated.rs` remain for
the same reason: candidates from `resolve_target_classes` may
already carry model-specific members from a more specific resolution
path, while `resolve_class_fully_cached` with empty generic args
would return a less specialized version.

### Remaining opportunity

Threading generic args from `type_hint_to_classes_depth` through to
`resolve_class_fully_cached_with_generics` would let the cache
store `Builder<User>` and `Builder<Post>` as separate entries with
scope methods included. This requires a larger refactor to pass the
cache and generic args through the type resolution pipeline.

---

## 32. Targeted cache invalidation (done)
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Done**

### What was done

`update_ast` and `parse_and_cache_content_versioned` use targeted
invalidation instead of clearing the entire `resolved_class_cache`.
Only FQNs defined in the edited file (both old and new, to handle
renames) are evicted. Classes from other files keep their cached
resolution across edits.

With §31 (generic-keyed cache) and §33 (signature-level invalidation)
now complete, targeted invalidation compounds with both: vendor/stub
classes that are never edited stay cached across keystrokes
indefinitely, and editing inside method bodies triggers zero evictions.

No further code changes are needed.

---

## 33. Signature-level cache invalidation (done)
**Impact: High · Effort: Low-Medium**

### What was done

`signature_eq` methods were added to `ClassInfo`, `MethodInfo`,
`PropertyInfo`, `ConstantInfo`, and `ParameterInfo`. Each method
compares all resolution-relevant fields and ignores fields that
change on every keystroke (byte offsets) or are display-only
(descriptions, links).

`update_ast_inner` now compares old and new `ClassInfo` values using
`signature_eq` before evicting a FQN from the resolved-class cache.
When the signature has not changed (the overwhelmingly common case
during normal editing inside a method body), the cache entry is kept
warm.

Methods and properties are compared as name-keyed sets so that
reordering members in source does not trigger eviction. Parameters
are compared in order because parameter order matters for signature
help.

Combined with §31 (generic-keyed cache) and §32 (targeted
invalidation), this means:

- Typing inside a method body: zero evictions, all cache hits
- Adding/removing a method or changing a type hint: evicts only that
  class's FQN(s), dependents self-correct on next resolution
- Changing inheritance (extends, implements, use): evicts the class,
  dependents may briefly be stale (acceptable, same as §32)

For files with many classes (e.g. `example.php` with 164 classes),
editing inside any method body keeps all resolved entries warm,
turning the previous "evict everything" into "evict nothing" for the
common case.

No further code changes are needed.
