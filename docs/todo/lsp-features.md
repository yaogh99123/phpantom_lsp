## 2. Document Highlighting (`textDocument/documentHighlight`)
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Low**

When the cursor lands on a symbol, highlight all other occurrences of that
symbol in the current file.  This is a cheap, high-visibility UX
improvement — users expect it from any modern language server and notice
its absence immediately.

### Existing infrastructure

The `SymbolMap` already records every navigable symbol occurrence in
a file during `update_ast`.  Each `SymbolSpan` carries a `SymbolKind`
discriminant (`ClassReference`, `ClassDeclaration`, `MemberAccess`,
`Variable`, `FunctionCall`, `SelfStaticParent`, `ConstantReference`).
The highlight handler can reuse these spans directly — no additional
parsing or AST walking is needed.

### Implementation plan

1. **Register the capability** — set `document_highlight_provider: Some(OneOf::Left(true))`
   in `ServerCapabilities` inside `server.rs`.

2. **Add a handler method** on `Backend`:
   - Look up the `SymbolMap` for the file URI from `self.symbol_maps`.
   - Call `symbol_map.lookup(offset)` to find the `SymbolSpan` under the
     cursor.
   - Based on the `SymbolKind`, determine matching criteria:
     - `Variable { name }` → match all `Variable` spans with the same
       `name` that share the same enclosing scope (use
       `symbol_map.find_enclosing_scope(offset)`).
     - `ClassReference { name, .. }` / `ClassDeclaration { name }` →
       match all `ClassReference` and `ClassDeclaration` spans whose
       resolved name is the same FQN.
     - `MemberAccess { member_name, is_static, .. }` → match all
       `MemberAccess` spans with the same `member_name` and `is_static`
       flag.  Optionally resolve the subject type to avoid false positives
       across unrelated classes, but a name-only match is acceptable for v1.
     - `FunctionCall { name }` → match all `FunctionCall` spans with the
       same name.
     - `ConstantReference { name }` → match all `ConstantReference` spans
       with the same name.
     - `SelfStaticParent { keyword }` → match all `SelfStaticParent`
       spans with the same keyword within the same class body.
   - Iterate `symbol_map.spans` and collect every span that matches.
   - Convert each matching `SymbolSpan` to a `DocumentHighlight` with
     `range` computed from the byte offsets and `kind` set to
     `DocumentHighlightKind::Read` (or `Write` for assignment LHS
     variables, detectable via `symbol_map.var_def_kind_at`).

3. **Wire the LSP method** — implement `async fn document_highlight` in the
   `LanguageServer` impl in `server.rs`, delegating to the handler above.

### Highlight kind assignment

- Variable on an assignment LHS, parameter definition, foreach binding,
  or catch binding → `DocumentHighlightKind::Write` (check
  `var_def_kind_at` for the offset).
- Everything else → `DocumentHighlightKind::Read`.

### Scope rules

- **Variables** should be scoped to their enclosing function/method/closure
  body via `find_enclosing_scope`.  A `$user` in method A must not
  highlight `$user` in method B.
- **Class names, member names, function names, constants** are file-global —
  highlight all occurrences in the file regardless of scope.

---

## 3. PHPDoc block generation on `/**`
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

Typing `/**` above a function, class, property, or constant should
generate a complete doc block skeleton — not just offer tag completions
(which we already do via `@`-triggered completion inside existing doc
blocks). This is a distinct feature: the trigger is `/**` outside any
doc block, and the result is a multi-line snippet with all tags
pre-filled.

### What to generate

- **Functions/methods:** `@param` tags for every parameter (with type
  from native hint or inference), `@return` with the declared/inferred
  return type, `@throws` for uncaught exception types in the body.
- **Method overrides:** insert `{@inheritDoc}` instead of repeating the
  parent's documentation, unless the override changes the signature.
- **Classes/interfaces/enums:** `@package` or a blank summary line.
- **Properties:** `@var` with the declared/inferred type.
- **Constants:** `@var` with the value's type.

### Implementation

1. Register `/**` as a completion trigger (it already fires on
   individual characters; the trigger is the `/` after `**`).
2. In the completion handler, detect that the cursor is immediately
   after `/**` with only whitespace before the next declaration.
3. Find the declaration below the cursor (function, class, property,
   constant) by scanning forward in the AST or raw text.
4. Build a `CompletionItem` with `insertTextFormat: Snippet` containing
   the full doc block with tab stops for summary and description fields.
5. For functions, resolve parameter types using the same paths as
   signature help. For `@throws`, reuse the exception-detection logic
   from existing PHPDoc `@throws` completion.

**Note:** This is different from the existing `@`-triggered PHPDoc
completion which suggests individual tags inside an already-open doc
block. This generates the entire block from scratch.

---

## 6. Partial result streaming via `$/progress`
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

The LSP spec (3.17) allows requests that return arrays — such as
`textDocument/implementation`, `textDocument/references`,
`workspace/symbol`, and even `textDocument/completion` — to stream
incremental batches of results via `$/progress` notifications when both
sides negotiate a `partialResultToken`.  The final RPC response then
carries `null` (all items were already sent through progress).

This would let PHPantom deliver the *first* useful results almost
instantly instead of blocking until every source has been scanned.

### Streaming between existing phases

`find_implementors` already runs five sequential phases (see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § Go-to-Implementation):

1. **Phase 1 — ast_map** (already-parsed classes in memory) — essentially
   free.  Flush results immediately.
2. **Phase 2 — class_index** (FQN → URI entries not yet in ast_map) —
   loads individual files.  Flush after each batch.
3. **Phase 3 — classmap files** (Composer classmap, user + vendor mixed)
   — iterates unique file paths, applies string pre-filter, parses
   matches.  This is the widest phase and the best candidate for
   within-phase streaming (see below).
4. **Phase 4 — embedded stubs** (string pre-filter → lazy parse) — flush
   after stubs are checked.
5. **Phase 5 — PSR-4 directory walk** (user code only, catches files not
   in the classmap) — disk I/O + parse per file, good candidate for
   per-file streaming.

Each phase boundary is a natural point to flush a `$/progress` batch,
so the editor starts populating the results list while heavier phases
are still running.

### Prioritising user code within Phase 3

Phase 3 iterates the Composer classmap, which contains both user and
vendor entries.  Currently they are processed in arbitrary order.  A
simple optimisation: partition classmap file paths into user paths
(under PSR-4 roots from `composer.json` `autoload` / `autoload-dev`)
and vendor paths (everything else, typically under `vendor/`), then
process user paths first.  This way the results most relevant to the
developer arrive before vendor matches, even within a single phase.

### Granularity options

- **Per-phase batches** (simplest) — one `$/progress` notification at
  each of the five phase boundaries listed above.
- **Per-file streaming** — within Phases 3 and 5, emit results as each
  file is parsed from disk instead of waiting for the entire phase to
  finish.  Phase 3 can iterate hundreds of classmap files and Phase 5
  recursively walks PSR-4 directories, so per-file flushing would
  significantly improve perceived latency for large projects.
- **Adaptive batching** — collect results for a short window (e.g. 50 ms)
  then flush, balancing notification overhead against latency.

### Applicable requests

| Request | Benefit |
|---|---|
| `textDocument/implementation` | Already scans five phases; each phase's matches can be streamed |
| `textDocument/references` (§1) | Will need full-project scanning; streaming is essential |
| `workspace/symbol` (§5) | Searches every known class/function; early batches feel instant |
| `textDocument/completion` | Less critical (usually fast), but long chains through vendor code could benefit |

### Implementation sketch

1. Check whether the client sent a `partialResultToken` in the request
   params.
2. If yes, create a `$/progress` sender.  After each scan phase (or
   per-file, depending on granularity), send a
   `ProgressParams { token, value: [items...] }` notification.
3. Return `null` as the final response.
4. If no token was provided, fall back to the current behaviour: collect
   everything, return once.

---

## 7. Rename (`textDocument/rename`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

No rename refactoring support. Rename builds on find-references (§1) —
once all occurrences of a symbol are known, the rename handler produces
a `WorkspaceEdit` replacing each occurrence. The `SymbolMap`'s byte
ranges translate directly to LSP `Range`s via `offset_to_position`,
which makes generating the text edits straightforward.

For member renames, the stored `name_offset` on `MethodInfo`,
`PropertyInfo`, and `ConstantInfo` provides the declaration-site edit
position without text scanning.

**Vendor rejection:** The rename handler must reject renames for symbols
whose definition lives under the vendor directory. Users cannot
meaningfully rename third-party code. Use `vendor_uri_prefix` to detect
this and return an error via `prepareRename` (the LSP spec's
`textDocument/prepareRename` request exists specifically so the server
can reject a rename before the user types a new name).

---

---

## 9. Inlay hints (`textDocument/inlayHint`)
**Impact: Low · Effort: Medium**

Display inline type and parameter-name annotations in the editor without
the user having to hover or trigger completion. Since we already perform
deep type inference, this is primarily a presentation-layer feature —
surfacing data we already compute.

### Hint types (in priority order)

1. **Parameter name hints** — prepend the parameter name at call sites:
   `array_search(/*needle:*/ $x, /*haystack:*/ $arr)`. Skip when the
   argument is a variable whose name matches the parameter name (e.g.
   `foo($needle)` — the hint would be redundant).

2. **By-reference indicator** — annotate arguments passed by reference
   with `&`. This is a safety signal: the user may not realise a
   function mutates its argument.

3. **Inferred return type** — show the return type on functions/methods
   that lack an explicit return type declaration. Double-clicking (in
   editors that support it) could insert the type into the code.

4. **Variable assignment type** — show the inferred type after `$x =`
   assignments where the type isn't obvious from the RHS.

### Implementation

1. **Register the capability** — set `inlay_hint_provider: Some(OneOf::Left(true))` in `ServerCapabilities`.

2. **Handler:** Given a range, walk the AST within that range and emit
   `InlayHint` entries:
   - For call expressions: resolve the callable, zip arguments with
     parameters, emit parameter name hints.
   - For function/method declarations without return types: resolve the
     inferred return type, emit a hint after the closing `)`.
   - For variable assignments: resolve the RHS type, emit a hint after
     the `=`.

3. **Configuration:** Respect editor-level `editor.inlayHints.enabled`
   (handled by the client). Consider per-hint-type flags if users find
   some hints noisy (e.g. `phpantom.inlayHints.parameterNames: bool`).

**Performance:** Inlay hints are requested for the visible viewport
range only (editors send the range). For a typical screen of ~50 lines,
the cost is resolving types for the call expressions and assignments
visible — well within our per-file performance budget.

---

## 11. No go-to-definition for built-in (stub) functions and constants
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Clicking on a built-in function name like `array_map`, `strlen`, or
`json_decode` does not navigate anywhere. `resolve_function_definition`
finds the function in `stub_function_index` and caches it under a
synthetic `phpantom-stub-fn://` URI, but then explicitly skips navigation
because the URI is not a real file path. The same applies to built-in
constants like `PHP_EOL`, `SORT_ASC`, `PHP_INT_MAX` — they exist in
`stub_constant_index` for completion but `resolve_constant_definition`
only checks `global_defines`.

User-defined functions and `define()` constants work correctly. Only
built-in PHP symbols from stubs are affected.

**Fix:** either embed the stub source files as navigable resources (e.g.
write them to a temporary directory and use real file URIs), or accept
that stub go-to-definition is out of scope and document it as a known
limitation.

---

## 13. Selection Ranges (`textDocument/selectionRange`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

"Smart select" / expand selection. Given a cursor position, returns a
nested chain of ranges from innermost to outermost (e.g. identifier,
expression, statement, block, function, class, file). Most editors have
basic word/line/block expansion, but AST-aware selection ranges produce
much tighter expansions (e.g. selecting just the condition of an `if`,
then the full `if` block, then the enclosing method).

**Implementation:**

1. **Register the capability** — set `selection_range_provider:
   Some(SelectionRangeProviderCapability::Simple(true))` in
   `ServerCapabilities`.

2. **Handler:** For each requested position:
   - Walk the AST to collect all nodes whose span contains the position,
     from root down to the deepest leaf.
   - Reverse the list (deepest first) and build a `SelectionRange`
     linked list where each entry's `parent` points to the next wider
     range.
   - Return the innermost `SelectionRange`.

---

## 15. Document Links (`textDocument/documentLink`)
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Makes `require`, `require_once`, `include`, and `include_once` paths
Ctrl+Clickable in the editor. Useful for legacy codebases that use
file-based includes rather than PSR-4 autoloading.

**Implementation:**

1. **Register the capability** — set `document_link_provider:
   Some(DocumentLinkOptions { resolve_provider: Some(false) })` in
   `ServerCapabilities`.

2. **Handler:** Walk the AST for include/require expressions. For each:
   - Extract the path string from the argument (only handle string
     literals and simple concatenations like `__DIR__ . '/file.php'`).
   - Resolve the path relative to the current file's directory and the
     workspace root.
   - If the resolved path exists on disk, emit a `DocumentLink` with
     the target URI and the range of the string literal.

---

## 16. Type Hierarchy (`textDocument/prepareTypeHierarchy`)
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

Shows the class hierarchy (supertypes and subtypes) for a class under
the cursor. The LSP Type Hierarchy is a three-step protocol:

1. `textDocument/prepareTypeHierarchy` — returns a `TypeHierarchyItem`
   for the class/interface/trait under the cursor.
2. `typeHierarchy/supertypes` — returns parents. Walk the
   `extends`/`implements` chain, which is already resolved during
   inheritance. Essentially free.
3. `typeHierarchy/subtypes` — returns children. Calls
   `find_implementors`, same cost profile as go-to-implementation.

The supertypes direction is cheap (data already computed). The subtypes
direction has the same cost as go-to-implementation, but it's user-
initiated (triggered via a command, not automatic), so the latency is
acceptable.

*Depends on: go-to-implementation infrastructure (already shipped).*

**Implementation:**

1. **Register the capability** — set `type_hierarchy_provider:
   Some(TypeHierarchyServerCapabilities::Options(...))` in
   `ServerCapabilities`.

2. **Prepare handler:** Resolve the class under the cursor via
   `find_or_load_class`. Return a `TypeHierarchyItem` with the class
   name, kind, URI, range, and selection range.

3. **Supertypes handler:** Walk the class's `extends` and `implements`
   lists. For each parent/interface, resolve via `find_or_load_class`
   and return a `TypeHierarchyItem`.

4. **Subtypes handler:** Call `find_implementors` for the class name
   and return a `TypeHierarchyItem` for each result.

---

## 17. Incremental text sync
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

> **Cross-reference:** This item is also tracked as
> [performance.md §8](performance.md#8-incremental-text-sync) and
> roadmap item 89. The canonical spec lives here; the performance
> document includes it for completeness.

PHPantom uses `TextDocumentSyncKind::FULL`, meaning every
`textDocument/didChange` notification sends the entire file content.
Switching to `TextDocumentSyncKind::INCREMENTAL` means the client sends
only the changed range (line/column start, line/column end, replacement
text), reducing IPC bandwidth for large files.

The practical benefit is bounded: Mago requires a full re-parse of the
file regardless of how the change was received, so the saving is purely
in the data transferred over the IPC channel. For files under ~1000
lines this is negligible. For very large files (5000+ lines, common in
legacy PHP), sending 200KB on every keystroke can become noticeable.

**Implementation:**

1. **Change the capability** — set `text_document_sync` to
   `TextDocumentSyncKind::INCREMENTAL` in `ServerCapabilities`.

2. **Apply diffs** — in the `did_change` handler, apply each
   `TextDocumentContentChangeEvent` to the stored file content string.
   The events contain a `range` (start/end position) and `text`
   (replacement). Convert positions to byte offsets and splice.

3. **Re-parse** — after applying all change events, re-parse the full
   file with Mago as today. No incremental parsing needed initially.

**Relationship with partial result streaming (§6):** These two features
address different performance axes. Incremental text sync reduces the
cost of *inbound* data (client to server per keystroke). Partial result
streaming (§6) reduces the *perceived latency* of *outbound* results
(server to client for large result sets). They are independent and can
be implemented in either order, but if both are planned, incremental
text sync is lower priority because full-file sync is rarely the
bottleneck in practice. Partial result streaming has a more immediate
user-visible impact for go-to-implementation, find references, and
workspace symbols on large codebases.

---

## 18. Work-done progress for GTI and Find References
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

Go-to-Implementation takes ~3 seconds on large codebases (first
invocation) and Find References takes ~2 seconds. On older hardware
these numbers can be significantly higher. With no feedback, the user
cannot tell whether the request is working or frozen.

Add `workDoneProgress` reporting to both handlers so the editor shows
a progress indicator (e.g. "Scanning: 1,234 / 5,678 files") while
the scan runs.

**Implementation:**

1. In `goto_implementation` and `references`, check whether the
   client provided a `workDoneToken` in the request params.
2. If yes, send `WorkDoneProgressBegin` before starting the scan.
3. During file processing, send `WorkDoneProgressReport` with a
   percentage and message (file count or current phase). Throttle
   to at most one report per 100 ms to avoid notification spam.
4. Send `WorkDoneProgressEnd` when the scan completes.
5. If no token was provided, behave exactly as today.

The total file count is known up front (classmap size for GTI,
workspace file list for Find References), so percentage reporting is
straightforward.

**Existing infrastructure:** The `$/progress` helper methods
(`progress_create`, `progress_begin`, `progress_report`,
`progress_end` on `Backend`) are already implemented and used during
workspace initialization.  This item only needs to call those helpers
from the GTI and Find References handlers, checking the
`workDoneToken` from the request params.

**Relationship with partial result streaming (§6):** Work-done
progress tells the user "I'm working on it." Partial result streaming
(§6) additionally sends results incrementally as they are found. This
item is much simpler and provides immediate value without the
complexity of streaming partial results. §6 can build on top of it
later.

---

## 19. Formatting proxy (`textDocument/formatting`, `textDocument/rangeFormatting`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom does not ship a formatter and should not build one. Instead,
register as a formatting provider and proxy formatting requests to an
external tool installed in the project.

### Supported tools (in priority order)

1. **php-cs-fixer** — the most widely used PHP formatter. Detected via
   `vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer` or `php-cs-fixer` on `$PATH`.
2. **phpcbf** (PHP_CodeSniffer fixer) — detected via
   `vendor/bin/phpcbf` or `phpcbf` on `$PATH`.

When both are available, prefer php-cs-fixer. The user can override
the choice via `.phpantom.toml`:

```toml
[formatting]
tool = "php-cs-fixer"   # or "phpcbf" or "none"
```

Setting `tool = "none"` disables formatting entirely (PHPantom does
not register the capability).

### Document formatting

1. Write the file content to a temp file (or use `--dry-run --diff`
   to avoid touching the original).
2. Run `php-cs-fixer fix --using-cache=no --quiet <tempfile>` (or
   `phpcbf --stdin-path=<uri> -` for phpcbf).
3. Diff the result against the original and produce `TextEdit[]`.
4. Return the edits to the client.

For **range formatting**, php-cs-fixer does not natively support
formatting a range. Two options:
- Format the full file and filter the resulting edits to only those
  that touch the requested range.
- Skip range formatting registration if the tool does not support it.

### Error handling

- If the tool is not installed, do not register the formatting
  capability at all. Log the detection result.
- If the tool fails (non-zero exit, timeout), return an error
  response. Do not silently return no edits.
- Timeout: 10 seconds default, configurable via `.phpantom.toml`.

### Configuration

The `[formatting]` section in `.phpantom.toml`:

| Key     | Type   | Default     | Description                              |
|---------|--------|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| `tool`  | string | auto-detect | `"php-cs-fixer"`, `"phpcbf"`, or `"none"` |
| `timeout` | int  | 10000       | Maximum runtime in milliseconds          |

---

## 20. File rename on class rename
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a class, interface, trait, or enum is renamed and the file follows
PSR-4 naming conventions (filename matches the class name), the file
should be renamed to match the new class name.

### Behaviour

1. During `textDocument/rename` on a `ClassDeclaration`, after
   building the normal text edits, check whether the definition file's
   basename (without `.php`) matches the old class name.
2. If it does, add a `DocumentChange::RenameFile` operation to the
   `WorkspaceEdit` that renames the file to `NewClassName.php` in the
   same directory.
3. If the client's `workspace.workspaceEdit.resourceOperations`
   capability does not include `rename`, fall back to text-only edits
   (no file rename).

### Namespace rename (future extension)

When the user renames a namespace segment, all files under the
corresponding PSR-4 directory could be moved to a new directory
matching the new namespace. This is significantly more complex
(directory creation, moving multiple files, updating all `namespace`
declarations and `use` imports) and should be a separate item. For
now, only single-class file renames are in scope.

### Edge cases

- **Multiple classes in one file.** Do not rename the file if it
  contains more than one class/interface/trait/enum declaration.
- **File doesn't match class name.** Do not rename (the project
  may not follow PSR-4).
- **Vendor files.** Already rejected by the existing vendor check.
- **`DocumentChange` vs `changes`.** The `WorkspaceEdit` must switch
  from the `changes` map to `documentChanges` array when file
  operations are included, since `changes` does not support renames.
  Check the client capability first.

---

## 21. Semantic Tokens (`textDocument/semanticTokens/full`)
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

Semantic tokens give editors rich, type-aware syntax highlighting that
goes beyond what a TextMate grammar can achieve. Classes, interfaces,
enums, properties, methods, parameters, and type hints all get distinct
token types. This is one of the most visible LSP features: users
immediately notice when class names are coloured differently from
function calls.

### Token types

PHPantom should register at least these standard token types from the
LSP `SemanticTokenTypes` enum:

| Token type | Applied to |
|---|---|
| `namespace` | Namespace segments in `use` statements, FQN references, `namespace` declarations |
| `class` | Class names in declarations, type hints, `new`, `instanceof`, `::class`, catch clauses |
| `interface` | Interface names (when the symbol resolves to an interface) |
| `enum` | Enum names (when the symbol resolves to an enum) |
| `type` | Type aliases, `@template` parameter names in docblocks |
| `parameter` | Function/method parameters (`$param`) |
| `variable` | Local variables (`$var`), `$this` |
| `property` | Property access (`->prop`, `::$prop`) |
| `function` | Function names in calls and declarations |
| `method` | Method names in calls and declarations |
| `decorator` | PHP attributes (`#[Route(...)]`) |
| `comment` | PHPDoc tags (`@param`, `@return`, `@var`, `@template`, etc.) |
| `string` | String literals (editors handle this, but useful for embedded class-strings) |
| `keyword` | Language keywords (`if`, `class`, `function`, etc.) are handled by the editor grammar; skip these |

### Token modifiers

| Modifier | Applied when |
|---|---|
| `declaration` | The token is a declaration (class definition, function definition, variable assignment) |
| `static` | Static method calls, static property access |
| `readonly` | `readonly` properties |
| `deprecated` | Symbol has a `@deprecated` tag or `#[Deprecated]` attribute |
| `abstract` | Abstract classes or methods |

### Implementation plan

1. **Register capability.** In `initialize`, advertise
   `semanticTokensProvider` with `full: true` (no delta or range
   support initially). Include the `legend` listing all token types
   and modifiers.

2. **Handler.** On `textDocument/semanticTokens/full`, walk the file's
   symbol map (`SymbolMap`) and AST to produce a flat list of
   `SemanticToken` entries. Each entry is `(line, startChar, length,
   tokenType, tokenModifiers)`.

3. **Encoding.** LSP requires tokens as a flat `Vec<u32>` with
   relative line/column encoding. Convert absolute positions to the
   delta format before responding.

4. **Resolution.** For `ClassReference` spans, resolve the symbol to
   determine whether it is a class, interface, enum, or trait, and
   emit the appropriate token type. Fall back to `class` if resolution
   fails.

5. **Docblock tokens.** Emit `comment` tokens for PHPDoc tags and
   `type`/`class`/`interface`/`enum` tokens for type references inside
   docblocks (the symbol map already tracks these spans).

### Scope

- **Full document only.** Start with `full` requests. Delta
  (`textDocument/semanticTokens/full/delta`) and range
  (`textDocument/semanticTokens/range`) can be added later as
  performance optimizations.
- **No multiline tokens.** All PHP tokens that PHPantom cares about
  are single-line. Multiline string highlighting is left to the
  editor's grammar.
- **Leverage existing infrastructure.** The `SymbolMap` already
  contains classified spans (`ClassReference`, `FunctionCall`,
  `MethodCall`, `PropertyAccess`, `VariableReference`, etc.) with
  byte offsets. The main work is mapping these to LSP semantic token
  types and computing the delta encoding.
