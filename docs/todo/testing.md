# PHPantom — Ignored Fixture Tasks

There are **228 fixture tests** in `tests/fixtures/`. Of these, **207
pass** and **21 are ignored** because they exercise features or bug
fixes that are not yet implemented. Each ignored fixture has a
`// ignore:` comment explaining what is missing.

This document groups the 21 ignored fixtures by the underlying work
needed to un-ignore them. Tasks are ordered by the number of fixtures
they unblock (descending), then by estimated effort. Once a task is
complete, remove the `// ignore:` line from each fixture, verify the
fixture passes, and delete the task from this file.

After completing a task, run the full CI suite:

```
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --tests -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
php -l example.php
```

## 3. Property-level narrowing (5 fixtures)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §21](type-inference.md#21-property-level-narrowing)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Only local variables participate in type narrowing today.
`$this->prop instanceof Foo` inside an `if` block does not narrow
`$this->prop` for subsequent member access. The narrowing engine needs
to track member access expressions in addition to bare variables.

**Fixtures:**

- [ ] `narrowing/property_narrowing.fixture` — `if ($this->prop instanceof Foo)` narrows
- [ ] `narrowing/property_narrowing_negated.fixture` — negated property narrowing with early return
- [ ] `combination/property_instanceof.fixture` — property instanceof in combination context
- [ ] `member_access/access_from_union.fixture` — narrowing on `$this->prop` to access members
- [ ] `function/assert_property_instanceof.fixture` — `assert($this->prop instanceof Foo)` narrows

**Implementation notes:**

Extend `NarrowedType` (or the narrowing state structure) to accept a
member access path (`$this->prop`) as a narrowing key in addition to
plain variable names. When emitting narrowing from `instanceof` checks,
detect whether the left side is a property access and store the full
path. During variable resolution, when encountering `$this->prop`,
check the narrowing state for a matching member access path.

## 5. Attribute context support (3 fixtures)

**Ref:** [signature-help.md §4](signature-help.md#4-attribute-constructor-signature-help)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHP 8 attributes take constructor arguments (`#[Route('/path', methods: ['GET'])]`),
but no `CallSite` is emitted for attribute nodes. Signature help and
named parameter completion do not fire inside attribute parentheses.

**Fixtures:**

- [ ] `named_parameter/attribute_constructor.fixture` — named params in `#[Attr(name: <>)]`
- [ ] `signature_help/attribute_constructor.fixture` — sig help inside `#[Attr(<>)]`
- [ ] `signature_help/attribute_second_param.fixture` — sig help active param tracking in `#[Attr('a', <>)]`

**Implementation notes:**

In `symbol_map/extraction.rs`, add a visitor for `Attribute` AST nodes
that emits a `CallSite` pointing at the attribute class's `__construct`
method. The comma offsets and argument positions need to be extracted
the same way as for regular `ObjectCreationExpression` nodes. Once the
`CallSite` exists, signature help and named parameter completion should
work without further changes.

## 7. Invoked closure/arrow function return type (2 fixtures)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §30](type-inference.md#30-invoked-closurearrow-function-return-type)
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Immediately invoked closures and arrow functions do not resolve their
return type. `(fn(): Foo => new Foo())()` and similar patterns produce
`mixed`.

**Fixtures:**

- [ ] `call_expression/arrow_fn_invocation.fixture` — `(fn() => new Foo())()->` resolves
- [ ] `arrow_function/parameter_type.fixture` — arrow function parameter type for completion inside body

**Implementation notes:**

In the call expression resolution path, detect when the callee is a
parenthesized closure or arrow function expression. Extract the return
type from its signature or body. For `arrow_function/parameter_type`,
the arrow function parameter's type hint should be resolved the same
way closure parameters are (likely in `variable/closure_resolution.rs`).

---

## 8. `new $classStringVar` / `$classStringVar::staticMethod()` (2 fixtures)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §27](type-inference.md#27-new-classstringvar-and-classstringvarstaticmethod)
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a variable holds a `class-string<Foo>`, `new $var` should resolve
to `Foo` and `$var::staticMethod()` should resolve through `Foo`'s
static methods.

**Fixtures:**

- [ ] `type/class_string_new.fixture` — `new $classStringVar` resolves to the class type
- [ ] `type/class_string_static_call.fixture` — `$classStringVar::staticMethod()` resolves return type

**Implementation notes:**

In the object creation and static call resolution paths, when the class
name is a variable, resolve the variable's type. If it is
`class-string<T>`, extract `T` and use it as the class name.

---

## 11. `class-string<T>` on interface method not inherited (1 fixture)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §25](type-inference.md#25-class-stringt-on-interface-method-not-inherited)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When an interface method uses `class-string<T>` and a class implements
that interface, the generic return type is lost during inheritance
merging.

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `generics/class_string_generic_interface.fixture` — `class-string<T>` on interface method not propagated

---



## 13. Compound negated guard clause narrowing (1 fixture)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §23](type-inference.md#23-double-negated-instanceof-narrowing) (related)
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

After `if (!$x instanceof A && !$x instanceof B) { return; }`, the
surviving code should know that `$x` is `A|B`. This requires the
narrowing engine to invert compound negated conditions across guard
clauses.

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `completion/parenthesized_narrowing.fixture` — compound negated instanceof with guard clause narrows to union

---

## 15. Negated `@phpstan-assert !Type` (1 fixture)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §19](type-inference.md#19-negated-phpstan-assert-type)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low-Medium**

`@phpstan-assert !Foo $param` should remove `Foo` from the variable's
union type. The `!` prefix is not parsed today.

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `narrowing/phpstan_assert_negated.fixture` — negated assert removes type from union

---

## 16. Generic `@phpstan-assert` with `class-string<T>` (1 fixture)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §20](type-inference.md#20-generic-phpstan-assert-with-class-stringt-parameter-inference)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

`@phpstan-assert T $value` with `@template T` bound via a
`class-string<T>` parameter should infer the narrowed type from the
class-string argument at the call site.

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `narrowing/phpstan_assert_generic.fixture` — `assertInstanceOf(Foo::class, $x)` narrows `$x` to `Foo`

---

## 20. Elseif chain narrowing with `is_*()` (1 fixture)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §3](type-inference.md#3-parse-and-resolve-param-is-t--a--b-return-types) (related)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Simple `is_string()` narrowing works (tested in the passing
is_string_narrowing fixture), but an `if/elseif/else` chain
with `is_string` in the `if` and `is_int` in the `elseif` does not
strip both types in the `else` branch. This is an elseif-chain
narrowing propagation issue rather than `is_*()` parsing.

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `function/is_type_elseif_chain.fixture` — elseif chain strips `string` and `int`, leaving `Foobar` in else

---

## 21. `iterator_to_array()` return type (1 fixture)

**Ref:** [completion.md §1](completion.md#1-array-functions-needing-new-code-paths)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

`iterator_to_array()` should return the iterator's value type as an
array element type. This needs a special code path similar to the
existing `array_pop`/`array_shift` handling.

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `function/iterator_to_array.fixture` — `iterator_to_array($gen)` resolves element type

---

## 24. Variable scope isolation in closures (1 fixture)

**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

Variables declared outside a closure are visible inside the closure body
even without a `use()` clause. PHP closures have strict scope isolation:
only variables captured via `use($var)` or superglobals should be
available.

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `variable/closure_scope_isolation.fixture` — `$foobar` and `$barfoo` not visible inside closure without `use()`

**Implementation notes:**

During variable resolution, when the cursor is inside a closure body,
restrict the variable search scope to: (a) variables defined within the
closure body, (b) variables explicitly captured in the `use()` clause,
(c) `$this` if the closure is not `static`, and (d) superglobals. Do
not walk past the closure boundary into the enclosing scope.

---

## 25. Pass-by-reference parameter type inference (1 fixture)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §7](type-inference.md#7-narrow-types-of-var-parameters-after-function-calls)
**Impact: Low · Effort: Medium**

Functions that accept `&$var` parameters can change the variable's type.
After calling such a function, the variable's type should reflect the
function's documented effect (e.g. `preg_match($pattern, $subject, $matches)`
should give `$matches` an array type).

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `variable/pass_by_reference.fixture` — `&$var` parameter type inferred after call

---

## 26. Pipe operator (PHP 8.5) (1 fixture)

**Ref:** [type-inference.md §1](type-inference.md#1-pipe-operator-php-85)
**Impact: Low · Effort: Medium**

The `|>` pipe operator (PHP 8.5) passes the left side as the first
argument to the right side and returns the result.

**Fixture:**

- [ ] `pipe_operator/basic_pipe.fixture` — `$x |> foo(...)` resolves return type

---
