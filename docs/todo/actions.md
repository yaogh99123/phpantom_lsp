**Refactoring code actions overview:** A2 (Extract Function) depends on
forward-pass variable usage tracking with byte offsets across function
scopes.

## A34. Unified code action handler architecture

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

Refactor the code action system to use a unified handler architecture
inspired by rust-analyzer's assist system. Currently each code action
has a separate `collect_*` method called from a hand-maintained list in
`handle_code_action`, and deferred actions have a separate `resolve_*`
method dispatched via a string match in `resolve_code_action`. PHPStan
quick-fixes and refactoring actions use different code paths.

### Changes

1. **Unified handler signature.** Each code action becomes a function
   `fn(&mut Actions, &ActionContext) -> Option<()>`. Handlers are
   collected in a static array. `handle_code_action` iterates the array
   instead of calling methods one by one.

2. **Closure-based lazy resolve.** Handlers call
   `actions.add(id, label, range, |builder| { ... })`. The closure
   only runs when the action is being resolved, eliminating separate
   `collect_*` / `resolve_*` method pairs. The same handler function
   serves both Phase 1 (applicability check + lightweight stub) and
   Phase 2 (compute edit).

3. **Unified type for actions and diagnostic fixes.** Use the same
   struct for PHPStan quick-fixes and refactoring actions. The LSP
   layer gets one conversion path. Diagnostic fixes attach the same
   type as their quick-fix data.

4. **Sort by target range size.** Sort results by `target.len()` as
   a tiebreaker. Smaller target = more specific = higher priority.
   No manual priority numbers needed.

### When to implement

Do this when the next batch of code actions is added (A25, A28, etc.).
The refactoring pays for itself by making each subsequent action
cheaper to add: write one function, append it to an array.

## A3. Switch → match conversion

**Impact: Low · Effort: Medium**

Offer a code action to convert a `switch` statement to a `match`
expression when the conversion is safe (PHP 8.0+).

### When the conversion is safe

- Every `case` body is a single expression statement (assignment to the
  same variable, or a `return`).
- No `case` body falls through to the next (every case ends with
  `break`, `return`, or `throw`).
- The switch subject is a simple expression (variable, property access,
  method call) — not something with side effects that shouldn't be
  evaluated multiple times.

### Implementation

- Walk the AST for `Statement::Switch` nodes.
- Check each arm against the safety criteria above.
- If all arms pass, build the `match` expression text:
  - Each `case VALUE:` becomes `VALUE =>`.
  - `default:` becomes `default =>`.
  - The body expression (minus the trailing `break;`) becomes the arm's
    RHS.
  - If all arms assign to the same variable, hoist the assignment:
    `$result = match ($x) { ... };`.
  - If all arms return, convert to `return match ($x) { ... };`.
- Offer as `refactor.rewrite` code action kind.
- Only offer when `php_version >= 8.0`.

**Note:** This is a structural AST transformation with no type
resolution dependency, but the safety checks for fall-through and
side-effect-free subjects require careful AST inspection. Not trivial,
but bounded in scope.

## A8. Update Docblock to Match Signature

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a function or method signature changes (parameters added, removed,
reordered, or type hints updated), the docblock often falls out of sync.
This code action regenerates or patches the `@param`, `@return`, and
`@throws` tags to match the current signature.

### Behaviour

- **Trigger:** Cursor is on a function/method declaration that has an
  existing docblock. The code action appears when the docblock's `@param`
  tags don't match the signature's parameters (by name, count, or order),
  or when the `@return` tag contradicts the return type hint.
- **Code action kind:** `quickfix` (when tags are clearly wrong) or
  `source.fixAll.docblock` for a broader sweep.

### What gets updated

1. **`@param` tags:**
   - Add missing `@param` for parameters present in the signature but
     absent from the docblock.
   - Remove `@param` for parameters no longer in the signature.
   - Reorder `@param` tags to match signature order.
   - Update the type if the signature has a type hint and the docblock
     type contradicts it (e.g. docblock says `string`, signature says
     `int`). If the docblock type is _more specific_ than the signature
     (e.g. docblock says `non-empty-string`, signature says `string`),
     keep the docblock type (it's a refinement, not a contradiction).
   - Preserve existing descriptions after the type and variable name.

2. **`@return` tag:**
   - If the signature has a return type hint and the docblock `@return`
     contradicts it, update the type. Same refinement rule: keep the
     docblock type if it's more specific.
   - If the signature has a return type but no `@return` tag exists,
     do not add one (the type hint is sufficient). Only update or
     remove existing tags.
   - Remove `@return void` if redundant with a `: void` return type.

3. **Preserve other tags:** `@throws`, `@template`, `@deprecated`,
   `@see`, and any other tags are left untouched.

### Edge cases

- **Promoted constructor parameters:** Treat the same as regular
  parameters for `@param` purposes.
- **Variadic parameters:** `...$args` matches `@param type ...$args`.
- **No existing docblock:** This action only patches existing docblocks.
  PHPDoc generation on `/**` (F1) handles creating new ones.

### Implementation

- Parse the function signature to extract parameter names, types, and
  order, plus the return type.
- Parse the existing docblock to extract `@param` and `@return` tags
  with their positions, types, variable names, and descriptions.
- Diff the two lists to determine additions, removals, reorderings,
  and type updates.
- Build a `WorkspaceEdit` with targeted `TextEdit`s that modify only
  the changed lines within the docblock, preserving formatting,
  indentation, and unchanged tags.

## A10. Generate Interface from Class

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

Extract an interface from an existing class. The new interface contains
method signatures for all public methods in the class, and the class is
updated to implement it.

### Behaviour

- **Trigger:** Cursor is on a class declaration. The code action
  "Extract interface" appears.
- **Code action kind:** `refactor.extract`.
- **Result:** A new file is created containing the interface, and the
  original class is updated to add `implements InterfaceName`.

### What gets extracted

- All `public` methods (excluding the constructor) become interface
  method signatures: visibility, name, parameters with types and
  defaults, and return type.
- PHPDoc blocks from the extracted methods are copied to the interface
  (they often contain `@param`, `@return`, and `@template` tags that
  are essential for type information).
- Class-level `@template` tags are copied if any extracted method
  references those template parameters.
- Public constants are **not** extracted (interface constants have
  different semantics and this is rarely what users want).

### Naming

Default interface name: `{ClassName}Interface`. Place it in the same
namespace and directory as the class. If the file uses PSR-4, the
interface file path is derived from the namespace.

### Implementation

- Parse the class to collect public method signatures and their
  docblocks.
- Collect class-level `@template` tags if referenced by extracted
  methods.
- Generate the interface source: namespace declaration, use imports
  needed by the method signatures, interface declaration with method
  stubs.
- Build a `WorkspaceEdit` with two operations:
  1. `CreateFile` + `TextEdit` for the new interface file.
  2. `TextEdit` on the original class to add `implements InterfaceName`
     (and a `use` import if the interface is in a different file, though
     by default it's the same namespace).
- Format the generated interface to match the project's indentation
  style (detect from the source class).

### Edge cases

- **Class already implements interfaces:** Append to the existing
  `implements` list rather than replacing it.
- **Abstract methods:** Include them in the interface (they're already
  stubs).
- **Static methods:** Include them. Interfaces can declare static method
  signatures.
- **Generic classes:** If the class has `@template T` and a method
  returns `T`, the interface needs the same `@template` tag.

### Prerequisites

| Feature                             | What it contributes                                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Parser (`parser/classes.rs`)        | Extracts public method signatures with full type information                      |
| Implement missing methods (shipped) | Shared infrastructure for generating method stubs and `implements` clause editing |

## A16. Snippet Placeholder for Extracted Method Name

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low-Medium**

> **Blocked:** Requires `SnippetTextEdit` support in `lsp-types`.
> Upstream issue: [gluon-lang/lsp-types#310](https://github.com/gluon-lang/lsp-types/issues/310).
> The current `lsp-types` (0.94, pinned by `tower-lsp` 0.20) only
> covers LSP 3.17. `SnippetTextEdit` is an LSP 3.18 proposed feature.
> Revisit once the upstream issue is resolved and `tower-lsp` picks up
> the new version.

After an Extract Function/Method code action is applied, let the user
immediately rename the generated name by placing a snippet tab-stop on
it.  The contextual name (`createUsers`, `validateGuard`, …) serves as
the default, but the cursor lands directly on it so the user can type
over it without an extra rename step.

### Behaviour

- **Trigger:** User applies "Extract method 'createUsers'" (or any
  extract function/method action).
- **Result:** The workspace edit uses a `SnippetTextEdit` with
  `${1:createUsers}` for the method name at both the definition site
  and every call site.  The editor enters snippet mode and the user
  can type a new name that updates all locations simultaneously.
- **Fallback:** When the client does not advertise
  `workspace.workspaceEdit.snippetEditSupport`, emit a regular
  `TextEdit` (current behaviour — no snippet, no cursor placement).

### Implementation

1. **Store client capabilities at initialisation.**  In `initialize`,
   save the `InitializeParams.capabilities` (or at least the snippet
   edit flag) on the `Backend` struct.

2. **Check the flag in `collect_extract_function_actions`.**  When
   the client supports snippet edits, build the workspace edit with
   `DocumentChanges::Operations` containing `SnippetTextEdit` entries
   instead of plain `TextEdit`.  The new-text for the method name
   uses `${1:name}` syntax.

3. **Linked edit ranges (optional enhancement).**  If the client
   supports `workspace.workspaceEdit.changeAnnotationSupport` or
   linked edit groups, use those so that editing the name at the
   definition also updates the call site in real time.

### Prerequisites

| Feature                          | What it contributes                                       |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client capability storage        | Need to know whether the client supports snippet edits    |
| `SnippetTextEdit` in tower-lsp   | Verify tower-lsp exposes the snippet edit type            |
| Extract Function (shipped)       | The code action that this enhances                        |

## IDE-expected code actions

The following actions are offered by competing PHP IDEs (PHPStorm,
Intelephense) and are expected by users. Identified by cross-referencing
Rector, PHP-CS-Fixer, and Phpactor rule libraries against what major
IDEs actually surface as on-demand code actions.

Micro-simplifications (array_push→$arr[], strlen→==='', flip ternary,
etc.) are intentionally excluded. They are better served by batch tools
like Rector or PHP-CS-Fixer. An LSP should focus on actions that
benefit from editor context (cursor position, file state) rather than
competing with CLI transformers.

### A25. `strpos` → `str_contains` (PHP 8.0+)

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

Convert `strpos($haystack, $needle) !== false` to
`str_contains($haystack, $needle)` and the negated form
`strpos($haystack, $needle) === false` to
`!str_contains($haystack, $needle)`.

Also handle `strstr($haystack, $needle) !== false`.

PHPStorm offers this as an inspection with quick-fix. PHP-CS-Fixer's
`ModernizeStrposFixer` is the reference implementation. Edge case:
must verify exactly 2 arguments to `strpos` (the 3-argument form with
offset has different semantics).

**Code action kind:** `refactor.rewrite`.
**Guard:** `php_version >= 8.0`.

---

### A28. Explicit nullable parameter type (PHP 8.4 deprecation)

**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

Convert implicit nullable parameters to explicit nullable syntax:
`function foo(string $p = null)` → `function foo(?string $p = null)`.

PHP 8.4 deprecates the implicit nullable form. PHPStorm flags this.
PHP-CS-Fixer's `NullableTypeDeclarationForDefaultNullValueFixer`
handles union types, intersection types (DNF), and constructor
property promotion.

Only offer when the parameter has a type hint, a `= null` default, and
the type does not already include `null` (no `?` prefix, no `|null`
in a union).

**Code action kind:** `quickfix`.

---

### A29. Simplify boolean return

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

Convert if-return-boolean patterns to direct boolean returns:

- `if ($a === $b) { return true; } return false;` → `return $a === $b;`
- `if ($a === $b) { return false; } return true;` → `return $a !== $b;`

PHPStorm offers this. When the condition is not already boolean-typed,
wrap with `(bool)`.

Guard conditions:
- The if must have exactly one statement (a return of `true` or `false`)
  and no else/elseif.
- The next sibling statement must be `return` of the opposite boolean.

**Code action kind:** `refactor.rewrite`.

---

### A31. Remove always-else (extract guard clause)

**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Medium**

When an if-body ends with a flow-breaking statement (`return`, `throw`,
`continue`, `exit`), the `else` keyword is redundant. Promote the else
body to the same nesting level.

PHPStorm marks this as "unnecessary else". PHP-CS-Fixer's
`NoUselessElseFixer` is the reference. Edge case: don't remove else
blocks containing named function or class declarations (PHP evaluates
these eagerly, removing the else changes semantics).

**Code action kind:** `refactor.rewrite`.
