# Installation & Editor Setup

## Installation

### Pre-built Binaries

Download the latest binary for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AJenbo/phpantom_lsp/releases/latest). Available for:

- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-apple-darwin`
- `aarch64-apple-darwin`
- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

### Build from Source

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for full instructions. Quick version:

```bash
cargo build --release
# Binary is at target/release/phpantom_lsp
```

## Editor Setup

PHPantom communicates over stdin/stdout using the standard [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/). Any editor with LSP support can use it. Point the client at the `phpantom_lsp` binary with `php` as the file type. No special initialization options are required.

<summary><b>Zed</b></summary>

A Zed extension is included in the `zed-extension/` directory:

1. Ensure you have `rustc` available in your `$PATH`. This is part of the Rust [toolchain](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/)
2. Open Zed
3. Open the Extensions panel
4. Click **Install Dev Extension**
5. Select the `zed-extension/` directory

The extension automatically downloads the correct pre-built binary from GitHub releases for your platform. If you'd prefer to use a locally built binary, ensure `phpantom_lsp` is on your `PATH` and the extension will use it instead.

To make PHPantom the default PHP language server, add to your Zed `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "PHP": {
      "language_servers": ["phpantom_lsp", "!intelephense", "!phpactor", "!phptools", "..."]
    }
  }
}
```

```lua
vim.lsp.config['phpantom'] = {
  cmd = { '/path/to/phpantom_lsp' },
  filetypes = { 'php' },
  root_markers = { 'composer.json', '.git' },
}
vim.lsp.enable('phpantom')
```

<summary><b>VS Code</b></summary>

1. **Install a generic LSP client extension**

   * Recommended: [Generic LSP Client (v2)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=zsol.vscode-glspc)
   * Install via VS Code Marketplace:

     ```vscode-extensions
     zsol.vscode-glspc
     ```

2. **Download PHPantom LSP binary**

   * Get it from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AJenbo/phpantom_lsp/releases/latest)
   * Extract the binary and place it in a preferred location

3. **Configure the extension**

   * Open VS Code settings for Generic LSP Client (v2)
   * Set the path to your PHPantom binary
   * Add the Language ID: `php`
   * Restart VS Code

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>PHPStorm</b></summary>

1. **Download PHPantom LSP binary**

   * Get it from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/AJenbo/phpantom_lsp/releases/latest)
   * Extract the binary to a preferred location

2. **Install and configure LSP plugin**

   * Go to **Editor → Plugins** and install [LSP4IJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23257-lsp4ij)
   * Restart PHPStorm
   * Navigate to **Languages & Frameworks → Language Servers**
   * Click **+** to add a new server

     * Name: `PHPantom`
     * Command: path to your PHPantom binary
     * Mapping: set `PHP` on both the **Language** tab and the **File Type** tab (the dialogs are identical). Setting both ensures PHPStorm activates the server reliably.

## Project Configuration

PHPantom works best with Composer projects. It reads `composer.json` to discover autoload directories and vendor packages, so completions and go-to-definition only surface classes that your autoloader can actually load. Projects without `composer.json` fall back to scanning every PHP file in the workspace.

### `.phpantom.toml`

PHPantom supports an optional per-project configuration file for settings like PHP version overrides and diagnostic toggles.

To generate a default config file with all options documented and commented out:

```bash
phpantom_lsp --init
```

This creates a `.phpantom.toml` in the current directory. Currently supported settings:

```toml
[php]
# Override the detected PHP version (default: inferred from composer.json, or 8.5).
# version = "8.5"

[diagnostics]
# Report member access on subjects whose type could not be resolved.
# Useful for discovering gaps in type coverage. Off by default.
# unresolved-member-access = true

[indexing]
# How PHPantom discovers classes across the workspace.
#   "composer" (default) - use Composer classmap, self-scan on fallback
#   "self"    - always self-scan, ignore Composer classmap
#   "none"    - no proactive scanning, Composer classmap only
# strategy = "composer"
```

The file is optional. When absent, all settings use their defaults. New settings will be added as features land. Unknown keys are silently ignored, so the file is forward-compatible.

### Indexing Strategy

By default, PHPantom trusts Composer's autoloader to determine which classes exist in your project. This is intentional: it means completions, diagnostics, and go-to-definition reflect what your code will actually see at runtime. Classes that aren't autoloadable don't appear, because using them would be an error.

The `strategy` setting controls this behaviour:

| Strategy | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `"composer"` (default) | Use Composer's classmap when available, self-scan to fill gaps. Results match what `composer dump-autoload` knows about. |
| `"self"` | Ignore Composer's classmap entirely and scan every PHP file in the workspace. Discovers all classes regardless of autoloading. |
| `"none"` | Use only Composer's classmap with no fallback scanning. The most conservative option. |

Most projects should leave this at the default. Change it to `"self"` if your project loads classes outside of Composer (custom autoloaders, `require_once`, legacy inclusion patterns). Be aware that `"self"` will also surface vendor-internal classes and potential duplicates that Composer's autoloader would never load.

### Classes from other files are not found

PHPantom resolves cross-file classes through Composer's autoloading rules (PSR-4 mappings and the generated classmap). If a class exists in your project but PHPantom reports it as unknown, the most common causes are:

1. **The class isn't Composer-autoloadable.** If your project loads classes via `require_once`, `include`, or a custom autoloader alongside Composer, those classes won't be discovered by default. Set `strategy = "self"` in `.phpantom.toml` to scan all files.

2. **Composer's classmap is stale.** Run `composer dump-autoload` to regenerate it. PHPantom reads the classmap at startup.

3. **The class is in a directory not covered by `autoload` or `autoload-dev`.** Check that your `composer.json` PSR-4 mappings cover the directory where the class lives.
