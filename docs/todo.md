# PHPantom — Roadmap

This is the master index for all planned work. Each row links to the
domain document that contains the full specification. Items are
sequenced by **sprint priority** — what to build next to widen the type
intelligence lead, then close the LSP feature gap, maximising coverage
with each step.

| Label | Scale |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | **Critical**, **High**, **Medium-High**, **Medium**, **Low-Medium**, **Low** |
| **Effort** | **Low** (≤ 1 day), **Medium** (2-5 days), **Medium-High** (1-2 weeks), **High** (2-4 weeks), **Very High** (> 1 month) |

## Sprint 3 — Quick wins: close the visible gaps

Every item here directly removes something a Neovim/Zed/VS Code user
would notice as missing on day one. Document Symbols eliminates the
single most visible gap (empty outline, no breadcrumbs). Workspace
Symbols gives keyboard-driven navigation back to Neovim users.
Semantic Tokens provides type-aware syntax highlighting that goes
beyond what a TextMate grammar can achieve. The remaining items
round out the feature matrix with minimal risk.

The deferred performance items from Sprint 2.5 are included here
because they are prerequisites for keeping everything fast as the
feature surface grows.

| # | Item | Effort | Domain | Doc Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 113 | Semantic Tokens (`textDocument/semanticTokens/full`) | Medium | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §21](todo/lsp-features.md#21-semantic-tokens-textdocumentsemantictokensfull) |
| 22 | Selection Ranges (`textDocument/selectionRange`) | Low | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §13](todo/lsp-features.md#13-selection-ranges-textdocumentselectionrange) |
| 100 | Formatting proxy (`textDocument/formatting`) | Medium | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §19](todo/lsp-features.md#19-formatting-proxy-textdocumentformatting-textdocumentrangeformatting) |
| 81 | Work-done progress for GTI and Find References | Low | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §18](todo/lsp-features.md#18-work-done-progress-for-gti-and-find-references) |
| 101 | Argument count diagnostic | Low | Diagnostics | [diagnostics.md §7](todo/diagnostics.md#7-argument-count-diagnostic) |
| 88 | Early-exit and `Cow` return in `apply_substitution` | Low | Performance | [performance.md §7](todo/performance.md#7-recursive-string-substitution-in-apply_substitution) |
| 87 | Reference-counted `ClassInfo` (`Arc<ClassInfo>`) | Medium | Performance | [performance.md §2](todo/performance.md#2-reference-counted-classinfo-arcclassinfo) |

**After Sprint 3:** PHPantom feels like a complete LSP to everyday
users. Outline, breadcrumbs, workspace search, semantic highlighting,
folding, formatting, and smart select all work. Argument count errors
catch real bugs and serve as a canary for type engine correctness.
No one says "it's missing X" for basic editing workflows.

---

## Sprint 4 — Refactoring toolkit

Extract Function is the #1 personal feature request and something
that was available before the switch to PHPantom. Inline Variable,
Extract Variable, and Inline Function/Method have been specifically
requested by the Neovim tester. These share scope analysis
infrastructure with Extract Function, so building them together is
the most efficient path.

| # | Item | Effort | Domain | Doc Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | Clear refactoring gate | — | Refactoring | [refactor.md](todo/refactor.md) |
| 17 | Extract Function refactoring | Very High | Code Actions | [actions.md §3](todo/actions.md#3-extract-function-refactoring) |
| 76 | Inline Variable | Medium | Code Actions | [actions.md §7](todo/actions.md#7-inline-variable) |
| 77 | Extract Variable | Medium | Code Actions | [actions.md §8](todo/actions.md#8-extract-variable) |
| 78 | Inline Function/Method | High | Code Actions | [actions.md §9](todo/actions.md#9-inline-functionmethod) |
| 109 | Extract Constant | Medium | Code Actions | [actions.md §10](todo/actions.md#10-extract-constant) |

**After Sprint 4:** The core refactoring toolkit is complete. The
two most active testers have the features they specifically asked
for. Scope analysis infrastructure built here benefits future code
actions.

---

## Sprint 5 — Polish for office adoption

These items close the gaps that PHPStorm and VS Code + Intelephense
users at the office would notice. PHPDoc generation is the most
common "where did that go?" moment. Inlay hints are high-visibility
in VS Code. The implementation error diagnostic reuses existing code
action logic and pairs with the quick-fix. File rename on class
rename removes a friction point that Intelephense premium users
expect.

| # | Item | Effort | Domain | Doc Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | Clear refactoring gate | — | Refactoring | [refactor.md](todo/refactor.md) |
| 24 | PHPDoc block generation on `/**` | Medium | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §3](todo/lsp-features.md#3-phpdoc-block-generation-on-) |
| 40 | Inlay hints (`textDocument/inlayHint`) | Medium | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §9](todo/lsp-features.md#9-inlay-hints-textdocumentinlayhint) |
| 102 | Implementation error diagnostic | Medium | Diagnostics | [diagnostics.md §9](todo/diagnostics.md#9-implementation-error-diagnostic) |
| 99 | File rename on class rename | Medium | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §20](todo/lsp-features.md#20-file-rename-on-class-rename) |
| 103 | Stub extension selection (`[stubs] extensions`) | Low | Configuration | [config.md §stubs](todo/config.md#extension-stub-selection) |

**After Sprint 5:** PHPantom is ready for office colleagues. They
get PHPDoc generation, inlay hints, and the diagnostics they're used
to. Nobody switching from Intelephense (free or premium) feels like
they lost more than they gained.

---

## Sprint 6 — Type intelligence depth

Type intelligence depth is PHPantom's defining advantage. This sprint
deepens that lead with features that benefit the PHPStan enthusiast
and Laravel developer alike. File system watching eliminates the
"restart the server after composer update" friction.

| # | Item | Effort | Domain | Doc Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | Clear refactoring gate | — | Refactoring | [refactor.md](todo/refactor.md) |
| 26 | Inherited docblock type propagation | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §4](todo/type-inference.md#4-inherited-docblock-type-propagation) |
| 27 | `BackedEnum::from()` / `::tryFrom()` return type refinement | Low | Completion | [completion.md §1](todo/completion.md#1-backedenumfrom--tryfrom-return-type-refinement) |
| 28 | Pipe operator (PHP 8.5) type resolution | Low | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §1](todo/type-inference.md#1-pipe-operator-php-85) |
| 29 | Conditional return types `($param is T ? A : B)` | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §3](todo/type-inference.md#3-parse-and-resolve-param-is-t--a--b-return-types) |
| 31 | `key-of<T>` and `value-of<T>` resolution | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §16](todo/type-inference.md#16-key-oft-and-value-oft-resolution) |
| 37 | File system watching for vendor and project changes | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §5](todo/type-inference.md#5-file-system-watching-for-vendor-and-project-changes) |
| 38 | Property hooks (PHP 8.4) | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §6](todo/type-inference.md#6-property-hooks-php-84) |
| 35 | Resolution-failure diagnostics (unresolved function, unresolved PHPDoc type) | Medium | Diagnostics | [diagnostics.md §3, §7](todo/diagnostics.md#3-unresolved-function-diagnostic-new) |
| 91 | GTD for built-in symbols via project-level phpstorm-stubs | Low | External Stubs | [external-stubs.md §1](todo/external-stubs.md#phase-1-project-level-phpstorm-stubs-for-gtd) |

**After Sprint 6:** PHPantom has the deepest type intelligence of
any PHP language server. Conditional return types, `key-of`/`value-of`,
property hooks, and inherited docblock types all work. The type
engine advantage is unambiguous.

---

## Sprint 7 — Remaining LSP features & code actions

Low-effort LSP features that didn't fit earlier sprints, plus
code action polish.

| # | Item | Effort | Domain | Doc Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | Clear refactoring gate | — | Refactoring | [refactor.md](todo/refactor.md) |
| 34 | Document Links (`textDocument/documentLink`) | Low | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §15](todo/lsp-features.md#15-document-links-textdocumentdocumentlink) |
| 39 | Simplify with null coalescing / null-safe operator (code action) | Medium | Code Actions | [actions.md §2](todo/actions.md#2-simplify-with-null-coalescing--null-safe-operator) |
| 110 | Update docblock to match signature | Medium | Code Actions | [actions.md §11](todo/actions.md#11-update-docblock-to-match-signature) |
| 111 | Change visibility | Low | Code Actions | [actions.md §12](todo/actions.md#12-change-visibility) |

## Sprint 8 — Deep type accuracy & Laravel excellence

These items push type resolution accuracy beyond what any tool offers.
They're the long tail that makes PHPantom the definitive choice for
projects that care about types.

| # | Item | Effort | Domain | Doc Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| — | Clear refactoring gate | — | Refactoring | [refactor.md](todo/refactor.md) |
| 44 | Custom Eloquent builders (`HasBuilder` / `#[UseEloquentBuilder]`) | Medium | Laravel | [laravel.md §3](todo/laravel.md#3-custom-eloquent-builders-hasbuilder--useeloquentbuilder) |
| 45 | `abort_if`/`abort_unless` type narrowing | Medium | Laravel | [laravel.md §4](todo/laravel.md#4-abort_ifabort_unless-type-narrowing) |
| 46 | Narrow types of `&$var` parameters after function calls | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §7](todo/type-inference.md#7-narrow-types-of-var-parameters-after-function-calls) |
| 47 | SPL iterator generic stubs | Medium | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §8](todo/type-inference.md#8-spl-iterator-generic-stubs) |
| 48 | `LanguageLevelTypeAware` version-aware type hints | Medium | Completion | [completion.md §2](todo/completion.md#2-languageleveltypeaware-version-aware-type-hints) |
| 49 | `#[ArrayShape]` return shapes on stub functions | Medium | Completion | [completion.md §3](todo/completion.md#3-arrayshape-return-shapes-on-stub-functions) |
| 50 | Asymmetric visibility (PHP 8.4) | Low | Type Inference | [type-inference.md §9](todo/type-inference.md#9-asymmetric-visibility-php-84) |
| 51 | Type Hierarchy (`textDocument/prepareTypeHierarchy`) | Medium | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §16](todo/lsp-features.md#16-type-hierarchy-textdocumentpreparetypehierarchy) |
| 52 | `class_alias()` support | Medium | Completion | [completion.md §8](todo/completion.md#8-class_alias-support) |
| 53 | Attribute constructor signature help | Medium | Signature Help | [signature-help.md §4](todo/signature-help.md#4-attribute-constructor-signature-help) |
| 54 | Closure/arrow function parameter signature help | Medium | Signature Help | [signature-help.md §5](todo/signature-help.md#5-closure--arrow-function-parameter-signature-help) |
| 55 | Diagnostic suppression intelligence | Medium | Diagnostics | [diagnostics.md §6](todo/diagnostics.md#6-diagnostic-suppression-intelligence) |
| 56 | Partial result streaming via `$/progress` | Medium-High | LSP Features | [lsp-features.md §6](todo/lsp-features.md#6-partial-result-streaming-via-progress) |

**Note:** Item 51 (Type Hierarchy) depends on the go-to-implementation
infrastructure and should be scheduled after that work is stable. Item 56
(partial result streaming) addresses outbound latency for large result
sets. See also item 89 (incremental text sync) in the backlog, which
addresses the complementary inbound direction.

## Sprint 9 — Blade support

Blade is a multi-phase project tracked in [todo/blade.md](todo/blade.md).
Shipping Blade support makes PHPantom the first open-source PHP language
server with Blade intelligence.

| Phase | Scope | Key Items |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Blade-to-PHP preprocessor | Module skeleton, directive translation, source map, LSP wiring |
| Phase 2 | Component support | Template/component discovery, `<x-component>` parsing, `@props`/`@aware`, name completion |
| Phase 3 | Cross-file view intelligence | View name GTD, signature merging for `@extends`, component→template variable typing |
| Phase 4 | Blade directive completion | Directive name completion with snippet insertion |

---

## Backlog — Diminishing returns

These items improve accuracy in niche scenarios. They're worth doing
eventually but don't move the needle.
