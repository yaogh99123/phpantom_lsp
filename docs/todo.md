> Last updated: 2025-07-15

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier — so high-impact quick wins come first.

Each item carries two ratings:

| Label | Scale |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | How much this improves the user experience or closes competitive gaps: **Critical**, **High**, **Medium-High**, **Medium**, **Low-Medium**, **Low** |
| **Effort** | Expected implementation effort: **Low** (≤ 1 day), **Medium** (2-5 days), **Medium-High** (1-2 weeks), **High** (2-4 weeks), **Very High** (> 1 month) |

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Critical Impact

### 1. Hover (`textDocument/hover`)
**Impact: Critical · Effort: Low**

No hover support at all. Users can't see inferred types, docblock descriptions,
or method signatures by hovering. Most of the infrastructure already exists
(type resolution, class loading, docblocks) — wiring it into a hover handler
would be relatively straightforward and extremely high-impact.

---

### 2. Signature Help (`textDocument/signatureHelp`)
**Impact: Critical · Effort: Medium**

No parameter hints shown while typing function/method arguments. Named arg
completion partially fills this role, but proper signature help is more
ergonomic. This is a baseline expectation for any modern language server —
users rely on it constantly when calling unfamiliar APIs.

## High Impact

### 3. `in_array` strict-mode type narrowing
**Impact: High · Effort: Low**

When `in_array($needle, $haystack, true)` is used as a condition,
PHPStan narrows `$needle` to the haystack's value type.  For example:

```php
/** @var list<'active'|'inactive'> $states */
if (in_array($status, $states, true)) {
    // $status is narrowed to 'active'|'inactive'
}
```

This is one of the most common type guard patterns in real PHP code.
The third `true` argument (strict mode) is critical — without it the
narrowing is unreliable due to PHP's loose comparison.  PHPStan also
narrows the haystack to `non-empty-array` in the true branch.

See `InArrayFunctionTypeSpecifyingExtension` in PHPStan.

---

### 4. Pipe operator (PHP 8.5)
**Impact: High · Effort: Low**

PHP 8.5 introduced the pipe operator (`|>`):

```php
$result = $input
    |> htmlspecialchars(...)
    |> strtoupper(...)
    |> fn($s) => "<b>$s</b>";
```

The mago parser already produces `Expression::Pipe` nodes, and the
closure resolution module walks into pipe sub-expressions to find
closures. However, **no type resolution** is performed for the pipe
result — the RHS callable's return type is never resolved, so
`$result->` after a pipe chain produces no completions.

**Fix:** In `resolve_rhs_expression`, add a `Expression::Pipe` arm
that resolves the RHS callable (function reference, closure, or
arrow function) and returns its return type. For first-class
callable syntax (`htmlspecialchars(...)`), reuse the existing
`extract_first_class_callable_return_type` logic.

---

### 5. Function-level `@template` generic resolution
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

`MethodInfo` has `template_params` and `template_bindings` fields that
enable method-level generic resolution at call sites (e.g.
`@template T` + `@param class-string<T> $class` + `@return T`).
`FunctionInfo` has **neither** field, so standalone functions that use
`@template` lose their generic type information entirely.

The only function-level template handling today is
`synthesize_template_conditional` in `parser/functions.rs`, which
converts the narrow `@return T` + `@param class-string<T>` pattern
into a `ConditionalReturnType`.  This does not cover the general case
where template params appear inside a generic return type:

```php
/**
 * @template TKey of array-key
 * @template TValue
 * @param  array<TKey, TValue>  $value
 * @return \Illuminate\Support\Collection<TKey, TValue>
 */
function collect($value = []) { ... }

/**
 * @template TValue
 * @param  TValue  $value
 * @param  callable(TValue): TValue  $callback
 * @return TValue
 */
function tap($value, $callback = null) { ... }
```

After `$users = collect($userArray)`, the result is an unparameterised
`Collection` — element type information is lost, and
`$users->first()->` produces no completions.

This affects Laravel helpers (`collect`, `value`, `retry`, `tap`,
`with`, `transform`, `data_get`), PHPStan/Psalm helper libraries, and
any userland function using `@template`.

#### Implementation plan

1. **Add fields to `FunctionInfo`** (in `types.rs`):

   ```text
   pub template_params: Vec<String>,
   pub template_bindings: Vec<(String, String)>,
   ```

   Mirror the existing `MethodInfo` fields.

2. **Populate during parsing** (in `parser/functions.rs`):

   Extract `@template` tags via `extract_template_params` and
   `@param`-based bindings via `extract_template_param_bindings`,
   the same functions already used for method-level templates in
   `parser/classes.rs`.

3. **Resolve at call sites** (in `variable_resolution.rs`,
   `resolve_rhs_function_call`):

   After loading the `FunctionInfo` and before falling through to
   `type_hint_to_classes`, check whether the function has
   `template_params`.  If so:

   a. For each template param, try to infer the concrete type from
      the call-site arguments using `template_bindings` (positional
      match between `$paramName` and the `ArgumentList`).  Reuse
      the existing `resolve_rhs_expression` / `type_hint_to_classes`
      to get the argument's type.

   b. Build a substitution map `{T => ConcreteType, ...}`.

   c. Apply the substitution to `return_type` via
      `apply_substitution` before passing it to
      `type_hint_to_classes`.

   This mirrors what `apply_generic_args` does for class-level
   templates, but applied to a function call.

4. **Text-based path** (in `text_resolution.rs`):

   The inline chain resolver (`resolve_raw_type_from_call_chain`)
   also needs the same treatment for chains like
   `collect($arr)->first()->`.  After resolving the function's
   return type, apply template substitution before continuing the
   chain.

**Note:** The existing `synthesize_template_conditional` path for
`@return T` + `@param class-string<T>` should be kept as-is — it
handles the special case where the return type is the template param
itself, which is common for container-style `resolve()`/`app()`
functions.  The new general path handles the remaining cases.

See also: `todo-laravel.md` gap 11 (`collect()` and other helper
functions lose generic type info), which is the Laravel-specific
manifestation of this gap.

---

### 6. Parse and resolve `($param is T ? A : B)` return types
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

PHPStan's stubs use conditional return type syntax in docblocks:

```php
/**
 * @return ($value is string ? true : false)
 */
function is_string(mixed $value): bool {}
```

This is the mechanism behind all `is_*` function type narrowing in
PHPStan — the stubs declare the conditional, and the type specifier
reads it.  If we parse this syntax from stubs and `@return` tags, we
get type narrowing for `is_string`, `is_int`, `is_array`,
`is_object`, `is_null`, `is_bool`, `is_float`, `is_numeric`,
`is_scalar`, `is_callable`, `is_iterable`, `is_countable`, and
`is_resource` from annotations alone, without any hard-coded function
list.

The syntax also appears in userland code (PHPStan and Psalm both
support it), and in array function stubs:

```php
/**
 * @return ($array is non-empty-array ? non-empty-list<T> : list<T>)
 */
function array_values(array $array): array {}
```

**Implementation:** Extend the return type parser in
`docblock/types.rs` to recognise the `($paramName is Type ? A : B)`
pattern.  At call sites, check the argument's type against the
condition and select the appropriate branch.  This could reuse or
extend the existing `ConditionalReturnType` infrastructure.

---

### 7. Warn when composer.json is missing or classmap is not optimized
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom relies on Composer artifacts (`vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php`,
`autoload_psr4.php`, `autoload_files.php`) for class discovery. When these
are missing or incomplete, completions silently degrade. The user should be
told what's wrong and offered help fixing it.

#### Detection (during `initialized`)

| Condition | Severity | Message |
|---|---|---|
| No `composer.json` in workspace root | Warning | "No composer.json found. Class completions will be limited to open files and stubs." |

For the no-composer.json case, offer to generate a minimal one via
`window/showMessageRequest`:

1. **"Generate composer.json"** — create a `composer.json` that maps
   the entire project root as a classmap (`"autoload": {"classmap": ["./"]}`).
   Then run `composer dump-autoload -o` to build the classmap. This
   covers legacy projects and single-directory setups that don't follow
   PSR-4 conventions.
2. **"Dismiss"** — do nothing.

| `composer.json` exists but `vendor/` directory is missing | Warning | "No vendor directory found. Run `composer install` to enable full completions." |
| PSR-4 prefixes exist but no user classes in classmap | Info | "Composer classmap does not contain your project classes. Run `composer dump-autoload -o` for full class completions." |

The third condition needs care. The classmap is rarely empty because
vendor packages like PHPUnit use `classmap` autoloading (not PSR-4), so
there will be vendor entries even without `-o`. The real signal is:
the project's `composer.json` declares PSR-4 prefixes (e.g. `App\`,
`Tests\`), but none of the classmap FQNs start with any of those
project prefixes. This means the user's own classes were not dumped
into the classmap, which is exactly what `-o` fixes.

Detection logic:
1. Collect non-vendor PSR-4 prefixes from `psr4_mappings` (already
   tagged with `is_vendor`).
2. After loading the classmap, check whether any classmap FQN starts
   with one of those prefixes.
3. If there are project PSR-4 prefixes but zero matching classmap
   entries, the autoloader is not optimized.

#### Actions (via `window/showMessageRequest`)

For the non-optimized classmap case, offer action buttons:

1. **"Run composer dump-autoload -o"** — spawn the command in the
   workspace root, reload the classmap on success, show a progress
   notification.
2. **"Add to composer.json & run"** — add
   `"config": {"optimize-autoloader": true}` to `composer.json` so
   future `composer install` / `composer update` always produce an
   optimized classmap, then run `composer dump-autoload`.
3. **"Dismiss"** — do nothing.

#### UX guidelines

- The no-composer.json and no-vendor warnings are safe to show via
  `window/showMessage` (informational, no action taken).
- The classmap warning should use `window/showMessageRequest` with
  action buttons so the user explicitly opts in before we touch files
  or run commands.
- Only show once per session. Do not re-trigger on every `didOpen`.
- Never modify `composer.json` or run commands without explicit user
  confirmation via an action button.
- If the spawned `composer` command fails (e.g. PHP not installed
  locally, Docker-only setup), catch the error gracefully and show
  "Composer command failed. You may need to run it manually."
- Log the detection result to the output panel regardless (already done
  for the "Loaded N classmap entries" message, just add context when
  zero user classes are found).

---

### 8. Find References (`textDocument/references`)
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium-High**

Can't find all usages of a symbol. The precomputed `SymbolMap` (built
during `update_ast` for every open file) already records every navigable
symbol occurrence with byte offsets and a typed `SymbolKind` — class
references, member accesses, variables, function calls, etc. This is
exactly the index a find-references implementation needs for the current
file. The main work is cross-file scanning: iterating `ast_map` entries
(and lazily parsing uncached files) to collect matching symbol spans
across the project.

The `SymbolMap` also stores variable definition sites (`var_defs`) with
scope boundaries, which directly supports "find all references to this
variable within its scope" without re-parsing.

## Medium-High Impact

### 9. File system watching for vendor and project changes
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom loads Composer artifacts (classmap, PSR-4 mappings, autoload
files) once during `initialized` and caches them for the session. If
the user runs `composer update`, `composer require`, or `composer remove`
while the editor is open, the cached data goes stale. The user gets
completions and go-to-definition based on the old package versions
until they restart the editor.

#### What to watch

| Path | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php` | Changed | Reload classmap |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php` | Changed | Reload PSR-4 mappings |
| `vendor/composer/autoload_files.php` | Changed | Re-scan autoload files for global functions/constants |
| `composer.json` | Changed | Reload project PSR-4 prefixes, re-check vendor dir |
| `composer.lock` | Changed | Good secondary signal that packages changed |

All three `autoload_*.php` files are rewritten atomically by Composer
on every `install`, `update`, `require`, `remove`, and `dump-autoload`.
Watching these is sufficient to catch any package change.

#### Implementation options

1. **LSP `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`** — register file watchers
   via `client/registerCapability` during `initialized`. The editor
   handles the OS-level watching and sends notifications. This is the
   cleanest approach and works cross-platform. Register glob patterns
   for the vendor Composer files and `composer.json`.

2. **Server-side `notify` crate** — use the `notify` Rust crate to
   watch the file system directly. More control but adds a dependency
   and duplicates what the editor already provides.

Option 1 is preferred. The LSP spec's `DidChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions`
supports glob patterns like `**/vendor/composer/autoload_*.php`.

#### Reload strategy

- On change notification, re-run the same parsing logic from
  `initialized` for the affected artifact.
- Invalidate `class_index` entries that came from vendor files (their
  parsed AST may have changed).
- Clear and re-populate `classmap` from the new `autoload_classmap.php`.
- Log the reload to the output panel so the user knows it happened.
- Debounce rapid changes (Composer writes multiple files in sequence)
  with a short delay (e.g. 500ms) to avoid redundant reloads.

<!-- ============================================================ -->

## Medium Impact

### 10. No reverse jump: implementation → interface method declaration
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

Go-to-implementation lets you jump from an interface method to its concrete
implementations, but there is no way to jump from a concrete implementation
*back* to the interface or abstract method it satisfies.  For example,
clicking `handle()` in a class that `implements Handler` cannot jump to
`Handler::handle()`.

This would be a natural extension of `find_declaring_class` in
`definition/member.rs`: when the cursor is on a method *definition* (not
a call), check whether any implemented interface or parent abstract class
declares a method with the same name, and offer that as a definition
target.

---

### 11. `BackedEnum::from()` / `::tryFrom()` return type refinement
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

When calling `MyEnum::from($value)` or `MyEnum::tryFrom($value)`,
PHPStan resolves the return type to `MyEnum` (or `MyEnum|null` for
`tryFrom`) rather than the generic `BackedEnum` base type.  This is a
static method return type that depends on the calling class — the
same pattern as `static` return types on static methods.

We already handle `new static()` and `static` return types for
instance methods, but static method calls on enums may not flow
through the same path.  Verify and fix if needed.

See `BackedEnumFromMethodDynamicReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

### 12. Document Symbols (`textDocument/documentSymbol`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

No outline view. Editors can't show a file's class/method/property structure.

---

### 13. Workspace Symbols (`workspace/symbol`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low-Medium**

Can't search for classes/functions across the project. The `ast_map`
already contains `ClassInfo` records (with `keyword_offset`) and
`global_functions` contains `FunctionInfo` records (with `name_offset`)
for every parsed file. A workspace symbol handler would iterate these
maps, filter by the query string, and convert stored byte offsets to
LSP `Location`s.

---

### 14. No go-to-definition for built-in (stub) functions and constants
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Clicking on a built-in function name like `array_map`, `strlen`, or
`json_decode` does not navigate anywhere. `resolve_function_definition`
finds the function in `stub_function_index` and caches it under a
synthetic `phpantom-stub-fn://` URI, but then explicitly skips navigation
because the URI is not a real file path. The same applies to built-in
constants like `PHP_EOL`, `SORT_ASC`, `PHP_INT_MAX` — they exist in
`stub_constant_index` for completion but `resolve_constant_definition`
only checks `global_defines`.

User-defined functions and `define()` constants work correctly. Only
built-in PHP symbols from stubs are affected.

**Fix:** either embed the stub source files as navigable resources (e.g.
write them to a temporary directory and use real file URIs), or accept
that stub go-to-definition is out of scope and document it as a known
limitation.

---

### 15. Property hooks (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHP 8.4 introduced property hooks (`get` / `set`):

```php
class User {
    public string $name {
        get => strtoupper($this->name);
        set => trim($value);
    }
}
```

The mago parser (v1.8) already produces `Property::Hooked` and
`PropertyHook` AST nodes, and the generic `.modifiers()`, `.hint()`,
`.variables()` methods mean hooked properties are extracted for basic
completion. However:

- **Hook bodies are never walked.** Variables and anonymous classes
  inside `get`/`set` bodies are invisible to resolution.
- **`$value` parameter** inside `set` hooks is not offered for
  variable completion.
- **Asymmetric visibility** (`public private(set) string $name`) is
  not recognised — the `set` visibility is ignored, so filtering
  may incorrectly allow setting a property that should be
  write-restricted.

**Fix:** In `extract_class_like_members`, match `Property::Hooked`
explicitly, walk hook bodies for anonymous classes and variable
scopes, and parse the set-visibility modifier into a new
`set_visibility` field on `PropertyInfo`.

---

### 16. Narrow types of `&$var` parameters after function calls
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When a function takes a parameter by reference, the variable's type
after the call should reflect what the function writes to it.  PHPStan
has `FunctionParameterOutTypeExtension` for this.

Key examples:

| Function | Parameter | Type after call |
|---|---|---|
| `preg_match($pattern, $subject, &$matches)` | `$matches` | Typed array shape based on the regex |
| `preg_match_all($pattern, $subject, &$matches)` | `$matches` | Nested typed array based on the regex |
| `parse_str($string, &$result)` | `$result` | `array<string, string>` |
| `sscanf($string, $format, &...$vars)` | `$vars` | Types based on format specifiers |

The most impactful case is `preg_match` — PHPStan's
`RegexArrayShapeMatcher` parses the regex pattern to produce a precise
array shape for `$matches`, including named capture groups.  A simpler
first step would be to just type `$matches` as `array<int|string,
string>` when passed to `preg_match`.

**Implementation:** When resolving a variable's type after a function
call where the variable was passed by reference, look up the
function's parameter annotations for `@param-out` tags (PHPStan/Psalm
extension) or use a built-in map for known functions.

---

### 17. SPL iterator generic stubs
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

PHPStan's `iterable.stub` provides full `@template TKey` /
`@template TValue` annotations for the entire SPL iterator hierarchy:
`ArrayIterator`, `FilterIterator`, `LimitIterator`,
`CachingIterator`, `RegexIterator`, `NoRewindIterator`,
`InfiniteIterator`, `AppendIterator`, `IteratorIterator`,
`RecursiveIteratorIterator`, `CallbackFilterIterator`, and more.

This means `foreach` over any SPL iterator properly resolves element
types.  If we rely on php-stubs for these classes, we are almost
certainly missing these generic annotations.  We should either:

- Ship our own stub overlays for the SPL iterator classes with
  `@template` annotations (like PHPStan does), or
- Detect and use PHPStan's stubs when present in the project's
  vendor directory.

---

### 18. Partial result streaming via `$/progress`
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

The LSP spec (3.17) allows requests that return arrays — such as
`textDocument/implementation`, `textDocument/references`,
`workspace/symbol`, and even `textDocument/completion` — to stream
incremental batches of results via `$/progress` notifications when both
sides negotiate a `partialResultToken`.  The final RPC response then
carries `null` (all items were already sent through progress).

This would let PHPantom deliver the *first* useful results almost
instantly instead of blocking until every source has been scanned.

#### Streaming between existing phases

`find_implementors` already runs five sequential phases (see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § Go-to-Implementation):

1. **Phase 1 — ast_map** (already-parsed classes in memory) — essentially
   free.  Flush results immediately.
2. **Phase 2 — class_index** (FQN → URI entries not yet in ast_map) —
   loads individual files.  Flush after each batch.
3. **Phase 3 — classmap files** (Composer classmap, user + vendor mixed)
   — iterates unique file paths, applies string pre-filter, parses
   matches.  This is the widest phase and the best candidate for
   within-phase streaming (see below).
4. **Phase 4 — embedded stubs** (string pre-filter → lazy parse) — flush
   after stubs are checked.
5. **Phase 5 — PSR-4 directory walk** (user code only, catches files not
   in the classmap) — disk I/O + parse per file, good candidate for
   per-file streaming.

Each phase boundary is a natural point to flush a `$/progress` batch,
so the editor starts populating the results list while heavier phases
are still running.

#### Prioritising user code within Phase 3

Phase 3 iterates the Composer classmap, which contains both user and
vendor entries.  Currently they are processed in arbitrary order.  A
simple optimisation: partition classmap file paths into user paths
(under PSR-4 roots from `composer.json` `autoload` / `autoload-dev`)
and vendor paths (everything else, typically under `vendor/`), then
process user paths first.  This way the results most relevant to the
developer arrive before vendor matches, even within a single phase.

#### Granularity options

- **Per-phase batches** (simplest) — one `$/progress` notification at
  each of the five phase boundaries listed above.
- **Per-file streaming** — within Phases 3 and 5, emit results as each
  file is parsed from disk instead of waiting for the entire phase to
  finish.  Phase 3 can iterate hundreds of classmap files and Phase 5
  recursively walks PSR-4 directories, so per-file flushing would
  significantly improve perceived latency for large projects.
- **Adaptive batching** — collect results for a short window (e.g. 50 ms)
  then flush, balancing notification overhead against latency.

#### Applicable requests

| Request | Benefit |
|---|---|
| `textDocument/implementation` | Already scans five phases; each phase's matches can be streamed |
| `textDocument/references` (§8) | Will need full-project scanning; streaming is essential |
| `workspace/symbol` (§13) | Searches every known class/function; early batches feel instant |
| `textDocument/completion` | Less critical (usually fast), but long chains through vendor code could benefit |

#### Implementation sketch

1. Check whether the client sent a `partialResultToken` in the request
   params.
2. If yes, create a `$/progress` sender.  After each scan phase (or
   per-file, depending on granularity), send a
   `ProgressParams { token, value: [items...] }` notification.
3. Return `null` as the final response.
4. If no token was provided, fall back to the current behaviour: collect
   everything, return once.

---

### 19. Rename (`textDocument/rename`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

No rename refactoring support. Rename builds on find-references (§8) —
once all occurrences of a symbol are known, the rename handler produces
a `WorkspaceEdit` replacing each occurrence. The `SymbolMap`'s byte
ranges translate directly to LSP `Range`s via `offset_to_position`,
which makes generating the text edits straightforward.

For member renames, the stored `name_offset` on `MethodInfo`,
`PropertyInfo`, and `ConstantInfo` provides the declaration-site edit
position without text scanning.

---

### 20. Array functions needing new code paths
**Impact: Medium · Effort: High**

These functions have return type semantics that don't fit into either
`ARRAY_PRESERVING_FUNCS` (same array type out) or `ARRAY_ELEMENT_FUNCS`
(single element out).  Each needs its own mini-resolver.

| Function | Return type logic | PHPStan extension |
|---|---|---|
| `array_keys` | Returns `list<TKey>` — extracts the *key* type, not value type | `ArrayKeysFunctionDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_column` | Extracts a column from a 2D array, preserving types | `ArrayColumnFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_combine` | Keys from first array arg, values from second | `ArrayCombineFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_fill` | `array<int, TValue>` preserving the fill value type | `ArrayFillFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_fill_keys` | Preserves key array type + value type | `ArrayFillKeysFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_flip` | Swaps key↔value types | `ArrayFlipFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_pad` | Union of existing value type + pad value type | `ArrayPadDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_replace` | Merge-like, preserving types from all args | `ArrayReplaceFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_change_key_case` | Preserves value type, transforms key type | `ArrayChangeKeyCaseFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_intersect_key` | Preserves first array's types (dedicated extension) | `ArrayIntersectKeyFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_reduce` | Returns the callback's return type (like `array_map`) | `ArrayReduceFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_search` | Returns key type of the haystack array | `ArraySearchFunctionDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_rand` | Returns key type of the input array | `ArrayRandFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_sum` | Computes numeric return type from value types | `ArraySumFunctionDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_count_values` | Returns `array<TValue, int>` | `ArrayCountValuesDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_key_first` / `array_key_last` | Returns key type (usually scalar, low completion value) | `ArrayFirstLastDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `array_find_key` | Returns key type (PHP 8.4) | `ArrayFindKeyFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `iterator_to_array` | Preserves iterable key/value types into array | `IteratorToArrayFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `compact` | Builds typed array from variable names | `CompactFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `count` / `sizeof` | Returns precise int range based on array size | `CountFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `min` / `max` | Returns union of argument types | `MinMaxFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |

## Low-Medium Impact

### 21. Asymmetric visibility (PHP 8.4)
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Separate from property hooks, PHP 8.4 allows asymmetric visibility on
plain and promoted properties. PHP 8.5 extended this to static
properties as well.

```php
class Settings {
    public private(set) string $name;

    public function __construct(
        public protected(set) int $retries = 3,
    ) {}
}
```

PHPantom currently extracts a single `Visibility` per property.
Completion filtering uses this to decide whether a property should
appear. A `public private(set)` property should appear for reading
from outside the class but not for assignment contexts.

**Fix:** Add an optional `set_visibility: Option<Visibility>` to
`PropertyInfo`. Populate it from the AST modifier list (the parser
exposes the set-visibility keyword). Completion filtering does not
currently distinguish read vs write contexts, so the immediate fix
is just to store the value; context-aware filtering can follow later.

### 22. `str_contains` / `str_starts_with` / `str_ends_with` → non-empty-string narrowing
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

When `str_contains($haystack, $needle)` appears in a condition and
`$needle` is known to be a non-empty string, PHPStan narrows
`$haystack` to `non-empty-string`.  The same applies to
`str_starts_with`, `str_ends_with`, `strpos`, `strrpos`, `stripos`,
`strripos`, `strstr`, and the `mb_*` equivalents.

This is lower priority for an LSP because `non-empty-string` does
not directly enable class-based completion, but it would improve
hover type display and catch bugs if we ever add diagnostics.

See `StrContainingTypeSpecifyingExtension` in PHPStan.

---

### 23. `count` / `sizeof` comparison → non-empty-array narrowing
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

`if (count($arr) > 0)` or `if (count($arr) >= 1)` narrows `$arr` to
a non-empty-array.  PHPStan handles a full matrix of comparison
operators and integer range types against `count()` / `sizeof()` calls.

See `CountFunctionTypeSpecifyingExtension` and the count-related
branches in `TypeSpecifier::specifyTypesInCondition`.

## Low Impact

### 24. Short-name collisions in `find_implementors`
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

`class_implements_or_extends` matches interfaces by both short name and
FQN (`iface_short == target_short || iface == target_fqn`).  Two
interfaces in different namespaces with the same short name (e.g.
`App\Logger` and `Vendor\Logger`) could produce false positives.
Similarly, `seen_names` in `find_implementors` deduplicates by short
name, so two classes with the same short name in different namespaces
could shadow each other.

**Fix:** always compare fully-qualified names by resolving both sides
before comparison.

---

### 25. Fiber type resolution
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

`Generator<TKey, TValue, TSend, TReturn>` has dedicated support for
extracting each type parameter (value type for foreach, send type
for `$var = yield`, return type for `getReturn()`). `Fiber` has no
equivalent handling — `Fiber::start()`, `Fiber::resume()`, and
`Fiber::getReturn()` don't resolve their generic types.

PHP userland rarely annotates Fiber with generics (unlike Generator),
so this is low priority. If demand appears, the fix would mirror the
Generator extraction in `docblock/types.rs`.

---

### 26. Non-empty-string propagation through string functions
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

PHPStan tracks `non-empty-string` through string-manipulating
functions.  If you pass a `non-empty-string` to `addslashes()`,
`urlencode()`, `htmlspecialchars()`, `escapeshellarg()`,
`escapeshellcmd()`, `preg_quote()`, `rawurlencode()`, or
`rawurldecode()`, the return type is also `non-empty-string`.

This is low priority for an LSP because the narrower string type
does not directly enable class-based completion.  However, if we
ever add hover type display or diagnostics, this information
would improve accuracy.

See `NonEmptyStringFunctionsReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

### 27. `Closure::bind()` / `Closure::fromCallable()` return type preservation
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low-Medium**

PHPStan preserves the closure's type through `Closure::bind()` and
resolves `Closure::fromCallable('functionName')` to the actual
function's signature as a `Closure` type.  This is relevant for DI
containers and middleware patterns but is a niche use case.

See `ClosureBindDynamicReturnTypeExtension` and
`ClosureFromCallableDynamicReturnTypeExtension` in PHPStan.

---

### 28. Remove deprecated text-search fallbacks
**Impact: Low · Effort: Medium**

The go-to-definition subsystem now uses the precomputed `SymbolMap` as
its primary path and stored byte offsets (`name_offset`, `keyword_offset`)
for cross-file jumps. The original line-by-line text scanners are marked
`#[deprecated]` and retained only as fallbacks for:

- Stubs and synthetic members where `name_offset == 0`
- Files where the parser panicked and no symbol map exists
- The go-to-implementation subsystem (not yet migrated)

Once the AST-based paths have been stable for a release cycle, these
deprecated functions can be removed:

| Function | File | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `find_definition_position` | `definition/resolve.rs` | `ClassInfo::keyword_offset` + `offset_to_position` |
| `find_function_position` | `definition/resolve.rs` | `FunctionInfo::name_offset` + `offset_to_position` |
| `find_define_position` | `definition/resolve.rs` | Store `define()` offset during parsing |
| `extract_word_at_position` | `definition/resolve.rs` | `SymbolMap::lookup` |
| `resolve_variable_definition_text` | `definition/variable.rs` | `SymbolMap::find_var_definition` + AST walk |
| `line_defines_variable` | `definition/variable.rs` | (only used by `resolve_variable_definition_text`) |
| `find_member_position_in_range` text path | `definition/member.rs` | `name_offset` + `offset_to_position` |

The go-to-implementation subsystem (`resolve_implementation` in
`definition/implementation.rs`) still uses `extract_word_at_position`
for cursor context detection. Migrating it to use `SymbolMap::lookup`
would let that deprecated function be removed entirely.

---

### 29. Non-array functions with dynamic return types
**Impact: Low · Effort: High**

PHPStan also provides dynamic return type extensions for many non-array
functions.  These are lower priority because they mostly refine scalar
return types (less impactful for class-based completion).

| Function | Return type logic | PHPStan extension |
|---|---|---|
| `abs` | Preserves int/float return type | `AbsFunctionDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `base64_decode` | `string\|false` based on strict param | `Base64DecodeDynamicFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `explode` | `list<string>` / `non-empty-list<string>` / `false` | `ExplodeFunctionDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `filter_var` | Return type depends on filter constant | `FilterVarDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `filter_input` | Same as `filter_var` | `FilterInputDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `filter_var_array` / `filter_input_array` | Typed array based on filter definitions | `FilterVarArrayDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `get_class` | Returns `class-string<T>` | `GetClassDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `get_called_class` | Returns `class-string<static>` | `GetCalledClassDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `get_parent_class` | Returns parent class-string | `GetParentClassDynamicFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `gettype` | Returns specific string literal for known types | `GettypeFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `get_debug_type` | Returns specific string literal | `GetDebugTypeFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `constant` | Resolves named constant to its type | `ConstantFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `date` / `date_format` | Precise string return types | `DateFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `date_create` / `date_create_immutable` | `DateTime\|false` | `DateTimeCreateDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `hash` / `hash_file` / etc. | Precise return types | `HashFunctionsReturnTypeExtension` |
| `sprintf` / `vsprintf` | Non-empty-string preservation | `SprintfFunctionDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `preg_split` | `list<string>\|false` based on flags | `PregSplitDynamicReturnTypeExtension` |
| `str_split` / `mb_str_split` | Non-empty-list | `StrSplitFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |
| `class_implements` / `class_uses` / `class_parents` | `array<string, string>\|false` | `ClassImplementsFunctionReturnTypeExtension` |

### 30. Diagnostics
**Impact: Low (large scope) · Effort: Very High**

No error reporting (undefined methods, type mismatches, etc.).

---

### 31. Code Actions
**Impact: Low · Effort: Very High**

No quick fixes or refactoring suggestions. No `codeActionProvider` in
`ServerCapabilities`, no `textDocument/codeAction` handler, and no
`WorkspaceEdit` generation infrastructure beyond trivial `TextEdit`s for
use-statement insertion.

#### 31a. Extract Function refactoring

Select a range of statements inside a method/function and extract them into a
new function. The LSP would need to:

1. **Scope analysis** — determine which variables are read in the selection but
   defined before it (→ parameters) and which are written in the selection but
   read after it (→ return values).
2. **Statement boundary validation** — reject selections that split an
   expression or cross control-flow boundaries in invalid ways.
3. **Type annotation** — use variable type resolution to generate parameter and
   return type hints on the new function.
4. **Code generation** — produce a `WorkspaceEdit` that replaces the selection
   with a call and inserts the new function definition nearby.

**Prerequisites (build these first):**

| Feature | What it contributes |
|---|---|
| Hover (§1) | "Resolve type at arbitrary position" — needed to type params |
| Document Symbols (§12) | AST range → symbol mapping — needed to find enclosing function and valid insertion points |
| Find References (§8) | Variable usage tracking across a scope — the same "which variables are used where" analysis |
| Simple code actions (add use stmt, implement interface) | Builds the code action + `WorkspaceEdit` plumbing |
