# PHPantom — Diagnostics

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

| Label | Scale |
|---|---|
| **Impact** | **Critical**, **High**, **Medium-High**, **Medium**, **Low-Medium**, **Low** |
| **Effort** | **Low** (≤ 1 day), **Medium** (2-5 days), **Medium-High** (1-2 weeks), **High** (2-4 weeks), **Very High** (> 1 month) |

## 1. `@deprecated` usage diagnostics
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

Report a diagnostic whenever the user references a class, method,
property, or function that is marked `@deprecated`. Most of the
detection is already in place — `is_deprecated` fields exist on
`ClassInfo`, `MethodInfo`, `PropertyInfo`, `FunctionInfo`, and
completion already strikes through deprecated items. This just
surfaces the same signal as a proper LSP diagnostic.

### Behaviour

- **Severity:** `Hint` with `DiagnosticTag::Deprecated`. This renders
  as a subtle strikethrough in most editors — visible but not noisy.
- **Range:** the span of the symbol reference (class name, method
  call, property access), not the declaration.
- **Message:** e.g. `'OldHelper::legacyMethod' is deprecated` — and
  if the `@deprecated` tag contains a description (e.g.
  `@deprecated Use NewHelper instead`), append it:
  `'OldHelper::legacyMethod' is deprecated: Use NewHelper instead`.
- **Publish timing:** alongside other diagnostics on
  `textDocument/didOpen` and `textDocument/didChange`.

### Implementation plan

1. During the symbol map walk (or a lightweight post-resolution pass),
   check every class reference, member access, and function call
   against the resolved `is_deprecated` flag.
2. For member accesses, this requires resolving the subject type and
   looking up the member in the fully-resolved class — the same
   path completion already takes.
3. Collect `Diagnostic` entries and include them in the
   `publishDiagnostics` notification.

This is a good first diagnostic to ship because it has **zero false
positives** — if the annotation says `@deprecated`, the warning is
always correct regardless of project quality.

## 2. Resolution-failure diagnostics
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Report diagnostics only for symbols and types that PHPantom's own engine
failed to resolve. This is **not** a general PHP linter — we don't check
argument counts, type compatibility, or missing semicolons. The goal is
twofold:

1. **Surface bugs in our engine.** On well-typed projects, every
   diagnostic is a false positive that points at a resolution code path
   we need to fix. This gives us a live regression signal.
2. **Guide under-typed projects.** On projects that aren't fully typed,
   the diagnostics show exactly where adding annotations would unlock
   completion and go-to-definition.

All diagnostics should be published on `textDocument/didOpen` and
`textDocument/didChange` (debounced). Severity is **Warning** for
unresolved types (the code may still run fine) and **Hint** or
**Information** for softer signals.

### Diagnostics to emit

| Diagnostic | Trigger | Severity | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unresolved class/interface | A type hint, `extends`, `implements`, `new`, or `::` reference that `find_or_load_class` cannot resolve after all phases (ast_map → classmap → PSR-4 → stubs) | Warning | `Class 'App\Foo' not found` |
| Unresolved function | A function call that `find_or_load_function` cannot resolve (global functions, namespaced functions, stubs) | Warning | `Function 'do_thing' not found` |
| Unresolved member access | `->method()` or `->property` on a type we *did* resolve, but the member doesn't exist after full resolution (inheritance + virtual providers) | Warning | `Method 'frobnicate' not found on class 'App\Bar'` |
| Unresolved type in PHPDoc | A `@return`, `@param`, `@var`, `@throws`, `@mixin`, or `@extends` tag references a class that cannot be resolved | Information | `Type 'SomeAlias' in @return could not be resolved` |


### What we explicitly do NOT report

- Syntax errors (Mago already handles that; we use error-tolerant parsing)
- Argument count / type mismatches (that's PHPStan's job)
- Unused variables, imports, or dead code
- Missing return types or parameter types
- Code style violations

### Implementation plan

1. **Add `publishDiagnostics` capability** in `initialize` response and
   store a handle to the client notification sender.
2. **Collect diagnostics during `update_ast`** — the symbol map walk
   already visits every class reference, member access, and function
   call. At each site, attempt resolution; on failure, record a
   `DiagnosticEntry { range, message, severity }`.
3. **Debounce and publish** — after `update_ast` completes (on open or
   change), send `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` with the collected
   entries. Debounce changes to ~200 ms so fast typing doesn't spam.
4. **Clear on close** — send an empty diagnostics array when a file is
   closed.
5. **User opt-out** — respect a config flag (e.g.
   `phpantom.diagnostics.enabled: bool`, default `true`) so users who
   rely solely on PHPStan / Psalm can turn ours off.

### Design notes

- **False positive budget:** treat every false positive as a bug. If a
  diagnostic fires on valid, well-typed code, the fix goes in the
  resolution engine, not in a suppression list. This keeps us honest.
- **No cross-file diagnostics** — only diagnose the file being
  edited/opened. We don't scan the whole project.
- **Stubs are authoritative** — if a symbol exists in phpstorm-stubs,
  it's resolved. We don't warn about `array_map` not being found
  because a stub was missing.
- **Performance** — resolution is already happening for completion and
  definition; diagnostics piggyback on the same code paths. The
  incremental cost should be small since we're just collecting failures
  that currently get silently swallowed.

## 3. Diagnostic suppression intelligence
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

When PHPantom proxies diagnostics from external tools (PHPStan, Psalm,
PHPMD, PHP_CodeSniffer), users need a way to suppress specific warnings.
Rather than forcing them to install a separate extension or memorise each
tool's suppression syntax, PHPantom can offer **code actions to insert
the correct suppression comment** for the tool that produced the
diagnostic.

### Behaviour

- When the cursor is on a diagnostic that originated from a proxied
  tool, offer a code action: `Suppress [TOOL] [RULE] for this line` /
  `…for this function` / `…for this file`.
- Insert the correct comment syntax for the originating tool:
  - PHPStan: `// @phpstan-ignore [identifier]` (line-level), or
    `@phpstan-ignore-next-line` above the line.
  - Psalm: `/** @psalm-suppress [IssueType] */` on the line or above
    the function/class.
  - PHPCS: `// phpcs:ignore [Sniff.Name]` or `// phpcs:disable` /
    `// phpcs:enable` blocks.
  - PHPMD: `// @SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.[RuleName])` in a docblock.
- For PHPantom's own diagnostics (§1, §2): support `@suppress PHPxxxx`
  in docblocks (matching PHP Tools' convention) and a config flag
  `phpantom.diagnostics.enabled: bool` (default `true`).

**Prerequisites:** Diagnostics infrastructure (§1 or §2 must ship
first so there are diagnostics to suppress). External tool integration
is a later phase — start with suppression for our own diagnostics.

**Why this matters:** This is the kind of feature that makes users
choose to configure PHPantom as their primary PHP language server
rather than running a separate linter extension alongside it. Generic
PHPMD/PHPStan extensions can show errors but can't offer contextual
suppression code actions because they don't understand PHP scope.

## 4. Unused `use` dimming
**Impact: Low-Medium · Effort: Low**

Dim `use` declarations that are not referenced anywhere in the file.
This is essentially free given the `use_map` and `SymbolMap` data we
already maintain — the only new work is the diff and the diagnostic
publish.

### Behaviour

- After `update_ast`, compare the file's `use_map` entries against all
  class/function/constant references in the `SymbolMap`.
- Any `use` alias that has zero references in the file gets a diagnostic
  with `severity: Hint` and `tags: [DiagnosticTag::Unnecessary]`.
  Editors render this as dimmed text — no error, no warning, just visual
  feedback.
- Publish alongside other diagnostics via `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`.

### What we do NOT do

- We do not offer a code action to remove them. That's php-cs-fixer's
  job and it does it well. We just provide the visual signal.
- We do not sort or reorganise imports.

### Edge cases

- `use Foo\{Bar, Baz}` group imports — each alias is checked
  individually; the group itself is only dimmed if *all* aliases are
  unused.
- `use function` and `use const` — same logic, check against function
  call and constant reference spans respectively.
- Trait `use` inside class bodies — these are not namespace imports and
  should not be checked.

**Prerequisites:** Diagnostics publishing infrastructure (from §1/§2).

## 5. Warn when composer.json is missing or classmap is not optimized
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium**

PHPantom relies on Composer artifacts (`vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php`,
`autoload_psr4.php`, `autoload_files.php`) for class discovery. When these
are missing or incomplete, completions silently degrade. The user should be
told what's wrong and offered help fixing it.

### Detection (during `initialized`)

| Condition | Severity | Message |
|---|---|---|
| No `composer.json` in workspace root | Warning | "No composer.json found. Class completions will be limited to open files and stubs." |
| `composer.json` exists but `vendor/` directory is missing | Warning | "No vendor directory found. Run `composer install` to enable full completions." |
| PSR-4 prefixes exist but no user classes in classmap | Info | "Composer classmap does not contain your project classes. Run `composer dump-autoload -o` for full class completions." |

For the no-composer.json case, offer to generate a minimal one via
`window/showMessageRequest`:

1. **"Generate composer.json"** — create a `composer.json` that maps
   the entire project root as a classmap (`"autoload": {"classmap": ["./"]}`).
   Then run `composer dump-autoload -o` to build the classmap. This
   covers legacy projects and single-directory setups that don't follow
   PSR-4 conventions.
2. **"Dismiss"** — do nothing.

The third condition needs care. The classmap is rarely empty because
vendor packages like PHPUnit use `classmap` autoloading (not PSR-4), so
there will be vendor entries even without `-o`. The real signal is:
the project's `composer.json` declares PSR-4 prefixes (e.g. `App\`,
`Tests\`), but none of the classmap FQNs start with any of those
project prefixes. This means the user's own classes were not dumped
into the classmap, which is exactly what `-o` fixes.

Detection logic:
1. Collect non-vendor PSR-4 prefixes from `psr4_mappings` (already
   tagged with `is_vendor`).
2. After loading the classmap, check whether any classmap FQN starts
   with one of those prefixes.
3. If there are project PSR-4 prefixes but zero matching classmap
   entries, the autoloader is not optimized.

### Actions (via `window/showMessageRequest`)

For the non-optimized classmap case, offer action buttons:

1. **"Run composer dump-autoload -o"** — spawn the command in the
   workspace root, reload the classmap on success, show a progress
   notification.
2. **"Add to composer.json & run"** — add
   `"config": {"optimize-autoloader": true}` to `composer.json` so
   future `composer install` / `composer update` always produce an
   optimized classmap, then run `composer dump-autoload`.
3. **"Dismiss"** — do nothing.

### UX guidelines

- The no-composer.json and no-vendor warnings are safe to show via
  `window/showMessage` (informational, no action taken).
- The classmap warning should use `window/showMessageRequest` with
  action buttons so the user explicitly opts in before we touch files
  or run commands.
- Only show once per session. Do not re-trigger on every `didOpen`.
- Never modify `composer.json` or run commands without explicit user
  confirmation via an action button.
- If the spawned `composer` command fails (e.g. PHP not installed
  locally, Docker-only setup), catch the error gracefully and show
  "Composer command failed. You may need to run it manually."
- Log the detection result to the output panel regardless (already done
  for the "Loaded N classmap entries" message, just add context when
  zero user classes are found).
