## 1. Find References (`textDocument/references`)
**Impact: High · Effort: Medium-High**

Can't find all usages of a symbol. The precomputed `SymbolMap` (built
during `update_ast` for every open file) already records every navigable
symbol occurrence with byte offsets and a typed `SymbolKind` — class
references, member accesses, variables, function calls, etc. This is
exactly the index a find-references implementation needs for the current
file. The main work is cross-file scanning: iterating `ast_map` entries
(and lazily parsing uncached files) to collect matching symbol spans
across the project.

The `SymbolMap` also stores variable definition sites (`var_defs`) with
scope boundaries, which directly supports "find all references to this
variable within its scope" without re-parsing.

---

## 2. Document Highlighting (`textDocument/documentHighlight`)
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Low**

When the cursor lands on a symbol, highlight all other occurrences of that
symbol in the current file.  This is a cheap, high-visibility UX
improvement — users expect it from any modern language server and notice
its absence immediately.

### Existing infrastructure

The `SymbolMap` already records every navigable symbol occurrence in
a file during `update_ast`.  Each `SymbolSpan` carries a `SymbolKind`
discriminant (`ClassReference`, `ClassDeclaration`, `MemberAccess`,
`Variable`, `FunctionCall`, `SelfStaticParent`, `ConstantReference`).
The highlight handler can reuse these spans directly — no additional
parsing or AST walking is needed.

### Implementation plan

1. **Register the capability** — set `document_highlight_provider: Some(OneOf::Left(true))`
   in `ServerCapabilities` inside `server.rs`.

2. **Add a handler method** on `Backend`:
   - Look up the `SymbolMap` for the file URI from `self.symbol_maps`.
   - Call `symbol_map.lookup(offset)` to find the `SymbolSpan` under the
     cursor.
   - Based on the `SymbolKind`, determine matching criteria:
     - `Variable { name }` → match all `Variable` spans with the same
       `name` that share the same enclosing scope (use
       `symbol_map.find_enclosing_scope(offset)`).
     - `ClassReference { name, .. }` / `ClassDeclaration { name }` →
       match all `ClassReference` and `ClassDeclaration` spans whose
       resolved name is the same FQN.
     - `MemberAccess { member_name, is_static, .. }` → match all
       `MemberAccess` spans with the same `member_name` and `is_static`
       flag.  Optionally resolve the subject type to avoid false positives
       across unrelated classes, but a name-only match is acceptable for v1.
     - `FunctionCall { name }` → match all `FunctionCall` spans with the
       same name.
     - `ConstantReference { name }` → match all `ConstantReference` spans
       with the same name.
     - `SelfStaticParent { keyword }` → match all `SelfStaticParent`
       spans with the same keyword within the same class body.
   - Iterate `symbol_map.spans` and collect every span that matches.
   - Convert each matching `SymbolSpan` to a `DocumentHighlight` with
     `range` computed from the byte offsets and `kind` set to
     `DocumentHighlightKind::Read` (or `Write` for assignment LHS
     variables, detectable via `symbol_map.var_def_kind_at`).

3. **Wire the LSP method** — implement `async fn document_highlight` in the
   `LanguageServer` impl in `server.rs`, delegating to the handler above.

### Highlight kind assignment

- Variable on an assignment LHS, parameter definition, foreach binding,
  or catch binding → `DocumentHighlightKind::Write` (check
  `var_def_kind_at` for the offset).
- Everything else → `DocumentHighlightKind::Read`.

### Scope rules

- **Variables** should be scoped to their enclosing function/method/closure
  body via `find_enclosing_scope`.  A `$user` in method A must not
  highlight `$user` in method B.
- **Class names, member names, function names, constants** are file-global —
  highlight all occurrences in the file regardless of scope.

## 3. PHPDoc block generation on `/**`
**Impact: Medium-High · Effort: Medium**

Typing `/**` above a function, class, property, or constant should
generate a complete doc block skeleton — not just offer tag completions
(which we already do via `@`-triggered completion inside existing doc
blocks). This is a distinct feature: the trigger is `/**` outside any
doc block, and the result is a multi-line snippet with all tags
pre-filled.

### What to generate

- **Functions/methods:** `@param` tags for every parameter (with type
  from native hint or inference), `@return` with the declared/inferred
  return type, `@throws` for uncaught exception types in the body.
- **Method overrides:** insert `{@inheritDoc}` instead of repeating the
  parent's documentation, unless the override changes the signature.
- **Classes/interfaces/enums:** `@package` or a blank summary line.
- **Properties:** `@var` with the declared/inferred type.
- **Constants:** `@var` with the value's type.

### Implementation

1. Register `/**` as a completion trigger (it already fires on
   individual characters; the trigger is the `/` after `**`).
2. In the completion handler, detect that the cursor is immediately
   after `/**` with only whitespace before the next declaration.
3. Find the declaration below the cursor (function, class, property,
   constant) by scanning forward in the AST or raw text.
4. Build a `CompletionItem` with `insertTextFormat: Snippet` containing
   the full doc block with tab stops for summary and description fields.
5. For functions, resolve parameter types using the same paths as
   signature help. For `@throws`, reuse the exception-detection logic
   from existing PHPDoc `@throws` completion.

**Note:** This is different from the existing `@`-triggered PHPDoc
completion which suggests individual tags inside an already-open doc
block. This generates the entire block from scratch.

## 4. Document Symbols (`textDocument/documentSymbol`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

No outline view. Editors can't show a file's class/method/property structure.

---

## 5. Workspace Symbols (`workspace/symbol`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low-Medium**

Can't search for classes/functions across the project. The `ast_map`
already contains `ClassInfo` records (with `keyword_offset`) and
`global_functions` contains `FunctionInfo` records (with `name_offset`)
for every parsed file. A workspace symbol handler would iterate these
maps, filter by the query string, and convert stored byte offsets to
LSP `Location`s.

---

## 6. Partial result streaming via `$/progress`
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

The LSP spec (3.17) allows requests that return arrays — such as
`textDocument/implementation`, `textDocument/references`,
`workspace/symbol`, and even `textDocument/completion` — to stream
incremental batches of results via `$/progress` notifications when both
sides negotiate a `partialResultToken`.  The final RPC response then
carries `null` (all items were already sent through progress).

This would let PHPantom deliver the *first* useful results almost
instantly instead of blocking until every source has been scanned.

### Streaming between existing phases

`find_implementors` already runs five sequential phases (see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` § Go-to-Implementation):

1. **Phase 1 — ast_map** (already-parsed classes in memory) — essentially
   free.  Flush results immediately.
2. **Phase 2 — class_index** (FQN → URI entries not yet in ast_map) —
   loads individual files.  Flush after each batch.
3. **Phase 3 — classmap files** (Composer classmap, user + vendor mixed)
   — iterates unique file paths, applies string pre-filter, parses
   matches.  This is the widest phase and the best candidate for
   within-phase streaming (see below).
4. **Phase 4 — embedded stubs** (string pre-filter → lazy parse) — flush
   after stubs are checked.
5. **Phase 5 — PSR-4 directory walk** (user code only, catches files not
   in the classmap) — disk I/O + parse per file, good candidate for
   per-file streaming.

Each phase boundary is a natural point to flush a `$/progress` batch,
so the editor starts populating the results list while heavier phases
are still running.

### Prioritising user code within Phase 3

Phase 3 iterates the Composer classmap, which contains both user and
vendor entries.  Currently they are processed in arbitrary order.  A
simple optimisation: partition classmap file paths into user paths
(under PSR-4 roots from `composer.json` `autoload` / `autoload-dev`)
and vendor paths (everything else, typically under `vendor/`), then
process user paths first.  This way the results most relevant to the
developer arrive before vendor matches, even within a single phase.

### Granularity options

- **Per-phase batches** (simplest) — one `$/progress` notification at
  each of the five phase boundaries listed above.
- **Per-file streaming** — within Phases 3 and 5, emit results as each
  file is parsed from disk instead of waiting for the entire phase to
  finish.  Phase 3 can iterate hundreds of classmap files and Phase 5
  recursively walks PSR-4 directories, so per-file flushing would
  significantly improve perceived latency for large projects.
- **Adaptive batching** — collect results for a short window (e.g. 50 ms)
  then flush, balancing notification overhead against latency.

### Applicable requests

| Request | Benefit |
|---|---|
| `textDocument/implementation` | Already scans five phases; each phase's matches can be streamed |
| `textDocument/references` (§1) | Will need full-project scanning; streaming is essential |
| `workspace/symbol` (§5) | Searches every known class/function; early batches feel instant |
| `textDocument/completion` | Less critical (usually fast), but long chains through vendor code could benefit |

### Implementation sketch

1. Check whether the client sent a `partialResultToken` in the request
   params.
2. If yes, create a `$/progress` sender.  After each scan phase (or
   per-file, depending on granularity), send a
   `ProgressParams { token, value: [items...] }` notification.
3. Return `null` as the final response.
4. If no token was provided, fall back to the current behaviour: collect
   everything, return once.

---

## 7. Rename (`textDocument/rename`)
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium-High**

No rename refactoring support. Rename builds on find-references (§1) —
once all occurrences of a symbol are known, the rename handler produces
a `WorkspaceEdit` replacing each occurrence. The `SymbolMap`'s byte
ranges translate directly to LSP `Range`s via `offset_to_position`,
which makes generating the text edits straightforward.

For member renames, the stored `name_offset` on `MethodInfo`,
`PropertyInfo`, and `ConstantInfo` provides the declaration-site edit
position without text scanning.

---

## 8. Code Lens: jump to prototype method
**Impact: Low · Effort: Low**

When a method overrides a parent class method or implements an interface
method, show a code lens above the method declaration linking to the
prototype (base) method. Clicking the lens navigates to the parent/
interface declaration.

**Why only this one code lens:** Most code lens features (reference
counts, implementation counts, trait usage counts) require scanning the
entire workspace, which conflicts with our lazy-loading design. But
"jump to prototype" only needs the class hierarchy of the *current*
class — data we already fully resolve via `resolve_class_with_inheritance`.

### Implementation

1. **Register the capability** — set `code_lens_provider: Some(CodeLensOptions { resolve_provider: Some(false) })` in `ServerCapabilities`.

2. **Handler:** For each method in the file's AST:
   - Resolve the enclosing class via `find_or_load_class`.
   - Walk the inheritance chain (parent classes, then interfaces) to
     find a method with the same name.
   - If found, emit a `CodeLens` with the method's declaration range
     and a `Command` that triggers go-to-definition for the parent
     method's location.
   - Label: `↑ ParentClass::methodName` or `◆ InterfaceName::methodName`.

3. **Performance:** Only process the current file's methods. The class
   loader cache means parent lookups are fast. For a file with 20
   methods, this is 20 cache lookups — negligible.

**Future expansion:** If/when Find References ships and proves fast
enough for interactive use, reference count lenses could be added
behind a config flag. But the prototype lens stands alone without
that dependency.

## 9. Inlay hints (`textDocument/inlayHint`)
**Impact: Low · Effort: Medium**

Display inline type and parameter-name annotations in the editor without
the user having to hover or trigger completion. Since we already perform
deep type inference, this is primarily a presentation-layer feature —
surfacing data we already compute.

### Hint types (in priority order)

1. **Parameter name hints** — prepend the parameter name at call sites:
   `array_search(/*needle:*/ $x, /*haystack:*/ $arr)`. Skip when the
   argument is a variable whose name matches the parameter name (e.g.
   `foo($needle)` — the hint would be redundant).

2. **By-reference indicator** — annotate arguments passed by reference
   with `&`. This is a safety signal: the user may not realise a
   function mutates its argument.

3. **Inferred return type** — show the return type on functions/methods
   that lack an explicit return type declaration. Double-clicking (in
   editors that support it) could insert the type into the code.

4. **Variable assignment type** — show the inferred type after `$x =`
   assignments where the type isn't obvious from the RHS.

### Implementation

1. **Register the capability** — set `inlay_hint_provider: Some(OneOf::Left(true))` in `ServerCapabilities`.

2. **Handler:** Given a range, walk the AST within that range and emit
   `InlayHint` entries:
   - For call expressions: resolve the callable, zip arguments with
     parameters, emit parameter name hints.
   - For function/method declarations without return types: resolve the
     inferred return type, emit a hint after the closing `)`.
   - For variable assignments: resolve the RHS type, emit a hint after
     the `=`.

3. **Configuration:** Respect editor-level `editor.inlayHints.enabled`
   (handled by the client). Consider per-hint-type flags if users find
   some hints noisy (e.g. `phpantom.inlayHints.parameterNames: bool`).

**Performance:** Inlay hints are requested for the visible viewport
range only (editors send the range). For a typical screen of ~50 lines,
the cost is resolving types for the call expressions and assignments
visible — well within our per-file performance budget.

## 10. Reverse jump: implementation → interface method declaration
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Low**

Go-to-implementation lets you jump from an interface method to its concrete
implementations, but there is no way to jump from a concrete implementation
*back* to the interface or abstract method it satisfies.  For example,
clicking `handle()` in a class that `implements Handler` cannot jump to
`Handler::handle()`.

This would be a natural extension of `find_declaring_class` in
`definition/member.rs`: when the cursor is on a method *definition* (not
a call), check whether any implemented interface or parent abstract class
declares a method with the same name, and offer that as a definition
target.

---

## 11. No go-to-definition for built-in (stub) functions and constants
**Impact: Medium · Effort: Medium**

Clicking on a built-in function name like `array_map`, `strlen`, or
`json_decode` does not navigate anywhere. `resolve_function_definition`
finds the function in `stub_function_index` and caches it under a
synthetic `phpantom-stub-fn://` URI, but then explicitly skips navigation
because the URI is not a real file path. The same applies to built-in
constants like `PHP_EOL`, `SORT_ASC`, `PHP_INT_MAX` — they exist in
`stub_constant_index` for completion but `resolve_constant_definition`
only checks `global_defines`.

User-defined functions and `define()` constants work correctly. Only
built-in PHP symbols from stubs are affected.

**Fix:** either embed the stub source files as navigable resources (e.g.
write them to a temporary directory and use real file URIs), or accept
that stub go-to-definition is out of scope and document it as a known
limitation.
